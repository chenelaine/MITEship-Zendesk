<p><strong> Annual interest / Cost of Capital: </strong> Annual interest is what an investor expect from its investments - and what debt holders have to pay while they keep the money they borrowed. The minimum interest rate an investor demands from his investments is called Cost of Capital, i.e. it is the cost in terms of annual interest that the investor incurs for his own money.  Annual interest is often referred to as "X % p.a.", meaning one should pay X % per annum of interest. <strong><em>cite?</em></strong> In accounting, the cost of capital is the cost of a company's funds (both debt and equity), or, from an investor's point of view "the shareholder's required return on a portfolio company's existing securities".

<p><strong> Dilution: </strong>Say you own 800 shares of your startups' 1,000 shares. You and your team decide to raise capital from an investors, who wants to own 20% of your company. Your company then issues 250 new shares which are bought by the investor, who now owns 250/1,250 = 20% of the company. In this case, the investor’s money stays in the company to be utilized in its activities, and your 80% of the company gets diluted to 64% (800 shares of 1,250). If the company does not issue new shares, and you sell 250 of your own shares to the investor, he will then own 250/1,000 = 25% of the company, and the money will go to your pocket, for your own use.</p>

<p><strong> Value creation - products and service:  </strong>Value creation is a term that is used in two occasions. In the first definition, value creation is the benefit generated by a product or service. If a consumer product creates value for you, this creation is reflected as your Willingness to Pay for such product. As an example, let's say you invented a new heater that saves 10 dollars/month in energy. This value creation will be reflect in the willingness to pay for heaters - i.e. I'd be willing to buy it instead of another heater if it is up to 10 dollars/month more expensive. This increased willingness to pay is the value created by the product. Sometimes, value creation might be hard to measure - if the new smartphone is 10% faster than the previous one, and consumers care about speed, this new smartphone creates value, which should impact the Willingness to Pay of users (i.e. it will be more expensive than the old one if sold simultaneously).</p>
<p><strong> Value creation - Financial definition: </strong> The second definition of Value Creation is the investors’ perspective. Let's say you borrow money in the bank for 10% per annum interest rate. If you invest it in your startup, it will create value if, at the time of an exit, the cash you receive is worth more than the money you borrowed (principal) plus 10% interest for every year. If it equals exactly the principal plus 10% p.a., then there was no value creation. If it is worth less than that, then there were a value destruction.</p>
