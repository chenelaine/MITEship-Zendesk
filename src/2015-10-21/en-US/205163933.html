<h1>What is the next step if I’m a technical person with an idea?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Founders' Decisions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Founder dating</em><br><p>Meet folks who can become your co-founder and do a project with them to see if you are compatible. Ideally a founding team should have a hacker, a hustler and a hipster. Also consider taking an entrepreneurship class at a local university – fabulous for running through the process of starting a startup and thinking through biz model issues, and even more fabulous for efficiently meeting many like minded people who are all looking for co-founders.</p></body>
