<h1>What kinds of teams are you looking for?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT Global Founders' Skills Accelerator (GFSA)</em><br><p>You are at an early stage. You might have entered the $100K, worked on your project in a course or simply are working on the side with fellow students. You don't have funding (not much, anyway), but you have made enough progress that this summer will be an excellent learning and growth opportunity. Quite possibly, you have even achieved some traction so that you will start the summer with momentum.Â </p></body>
