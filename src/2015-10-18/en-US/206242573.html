<h3>When should my startup become cash-flow-positive?</h3>

<p>Generally startups are not judged by how quickly they become cash flow positive - often there are other important considerations like proof of traction or growth of their subscriber base that factor into their metrics for success. </p>
<p>That said, startups are well advised to think about a viable, scalable and sustainable business model from the get-go, and iterate it with customers over time.  "Free" is not a business model and will not generally lead to a successful outcome (despite outlier cases like WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook).</p>
