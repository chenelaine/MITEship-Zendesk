<h3>What is incorporation?</h3>

<p dir="ltr">Incorporation is the process by which the startup becomes a separate entity from the people who own or operate the business.  As soon as you have your co-founders and you know how you want to divide up the equity, you would want to incorporate your corporate entity.  This protects your personal assets in case your company gets sued / owes money, or some such.</p>
