<p>Like your own Help Center, the Help Center on the Zendesk website is designed to provide a complete self-service support option -- for your Help Center.</p>
<p>You can search our knowledge base and community for a solution, or ask community members directly. If you can't find an answer, you can submit a request to an agent. For more information, see the <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/">Zendesk Help Center</a>.</p>
