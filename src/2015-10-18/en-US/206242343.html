<h3>What if I need fabrication space for my idea -- will dry and wet labs be made available?</h3>

<p>Yes. We love these kinds of projects and want to encourage them. Facilities on campus will be made available to the teams within the standard safety procedures of MIT. If you are selected, we are happy to work with you to define the resources you need and work to make sure they are available to you and the team.Â </p>
