<h2>MIT Global Founders' Skills Accelerator (GFSA)</h2>

<h3>What is required of my team once I am in the accelerator?</h3>

<p>We are looking for teams that are able to work the whole summer in Cambridge, MA and who are prepared to contribute to the community of teams in the accelerator by working primarily out of the Martin Trust Center space, engaging in the MIT GFSA and extracurricular activities, and actively sharing and learning with other founders in the program. We expect that you all come to each day of the program with an open mind and great attitude ready to learn, improve and accelerate.Â </p>
