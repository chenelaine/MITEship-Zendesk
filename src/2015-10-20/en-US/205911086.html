<h2>MIT Global Founders' Skills Accelerator (GFSA)</h2>

<h3>Do all of my team members have to be current MIT students?</h3>

<p>We are primarily focused on accelerating the skills of MIT students. While it is acceptable to have team members who are not current MIT students, the MIT students should be in charge. Please note that for the purposes of this program, we consider MIT students who graduate during the calendar year of the program (e.g. Feb/Jun 2015 for the summer 2015 program) to be equivalent to current MIT students, and we also consider current MIT postdocs to be current MIT students.</p>
