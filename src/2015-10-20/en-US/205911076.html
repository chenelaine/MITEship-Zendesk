<h2>MIT Global Founders' Skills Accelerator (GFSA)</h2>

<h3>How many people can be on my team?</h3>

<p>Teams are two to five members and are all founder-level participants. If you have other people working on the project (interns, etc.), that is okay, but don't include them on your application. We also cannot at this time guarantee office space for individuals other than your MIT GFSA team members.Â </p>
