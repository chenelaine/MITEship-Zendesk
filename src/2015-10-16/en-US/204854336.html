<h1>What do I do if I want to work on a problem but don’t know the solution?</h1>
<p>That’s the best way, much better than wanting to find a problem for a solution you already have baked! Get out of the building, talk to customers, figure out what their needs/wants are, then brainstorm solutions. Could be technical or not, could involve certain core techs or not. The sky’s the limit.</p>
