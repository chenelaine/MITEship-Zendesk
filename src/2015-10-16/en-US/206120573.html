<p><strong>Booking a classroom</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classrooms can be booked through this link: </span><a href="http://web.mit.edu/registrar/classrooms/rooms/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://web.mit.edu/registrar/classrooms/rooms/index.html</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classrooms are reserved through the Office of the Registrar. The website details pretty much everything you need to know about finding a room. Reserving a classroom is free.</span></p>
<p><strong>General rules for classroom use</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No food or drink are allowed inside classrooms. Sloan-located classrooms appear to be the exception, given the number of Sloan-run events that include food or drink served and consumed inside the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classrooms include the rooms on the first floor of Stata. The Campus Activities Complex (CAC) will offer (paid) support for the space outside the room -- setting up tables so you can have food there, that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many classrooms have basic A/V such as a projector.<br /></span></p>
