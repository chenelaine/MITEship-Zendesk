<h1>How do I balance the prioritization between features and bugs when doing demos?</h1>
<ul>
<li>As long as it is just demos, prioritize bug fixes solely around the demo path â€“ other bugs may need to wait</li>
<li>If the demo is to be left behind to be used by users not working on the project, then when the features are at MVP level, bugs must be taken care of.</li>
</ul>
