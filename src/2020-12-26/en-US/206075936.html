<h1>What is Inbound Marketing?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Marketing and Sales</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Inbound and Content Marketing</em><br><p>Hubspot, the authority on inbound marketing, <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defines the term as follows</a>:</p>
<p><em>"<span id="hs_cos_wrapper_module_14013060062774148" class="hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_widget_container hs_cos_wrapper_type_widget_container" data-hs-cos-general-type="widget_container" data-hs-cos-type="widget_container"><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_widget_900933656" class="hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_widget hs_cos_wrapper_type_raw_html" data-hs-cos-general-type="widget" data-hs-cos-type="raw_html"> Instead of the old outbound marketing methods of buying ads, buying email lists, and praying for leads, inbound marketing focuses on creating quality content that pulls people toward your company and product, where they naturally want to be. By aligning the content you publish with your customer’s interests, you naturally attract inbound traffic that you can then convert, close, and delight over time. </span></span>"</em></p>
