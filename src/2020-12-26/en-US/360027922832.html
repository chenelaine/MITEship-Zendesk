<h1>Should I hire a CTO or a dev shop?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Human Resources</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Hiring</em><br><p>My answer is always: it depends. So I want to outline some of the challenges and drawbacks here.</p>
<p><strong>When to Hire a CTO</strong></p>
<p>In almost every scenario I recommend startups find a technical co-founder who can spend all of their time building and managing their software. I make this recommendation for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s important to have someone who can speak about technical assets.</li>
<li>Having someone from the get-go to retain the technical knowledge is incredibly important.</li>
<li>They add value to the team.</li>
<li>They add a lot of credibility when pitching investors.</li>
<li>In-house engineers produce higher quality code (in general, not always the case).</li>
</ol>
<p>Although they can be hard to find, technical co-founders can make or break software businesses.</p>
<p><strong>When to Go The Dev Shop Route</strong></p>
<p>The only scenario in which I actually recommend working with a dev shop is when you already have someone technical on your team. In these instances you have some leverage that can ensure quality of code. When engineers at a dev shop know that you have in-house engineering talent that will be conducting code review they feel pressure to produce quality code.</p>
<p>On the contrary, code quality will suffer if they know that you do not have any in-house engineers. Likewise, they know that the project will no longer be their responsibility in a few months time. Why does this matter? Code quality is very important because without quality code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Routine maintenance becomes difficult and costly.</li>
<li>Changes and improvements are more time consuming.</li>
<li>Down the road when your business is growing your software most likely won’t scale to support your needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have an engineer who can work with the dev shop and monitor their work, then working with a dev shop is a great way to complement your in-house resources so that you can build and iterate faster.</p>
<p><strong>An Example</strong></p>
<p>I recently brought on an offshore engineer. Before we kicked off the engagement I was incredibly skeptical and had very low expectations. However, with proper product management and daily code reviews we have seen incredible results at less than 1/10th of the cost of working with our own engineers.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong><br><em>Make sure you have engineering talent and if you need more resources temporarily or cost effectively then consider complementing your team with a dev shop.</em></p></body>
