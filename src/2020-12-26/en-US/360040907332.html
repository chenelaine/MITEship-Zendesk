<h1>What is the difference between an online meeting and an online webinar?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Anti-Fragility in the face of crisis</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> How to use technology to help us go virtual</em><br><p>Most video conferencing platforms (Zoom, WebEx, GoTo products etc) have two ways you can interact virtually with an audience via video chat:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Meetings</strong>. Typically one person hosts the meeting and people can join as peers. Everyone will have a video feed and audio input into the virtual meeting. This is a good format for actual meetings, and small workshops with fewer than 30 people or so. </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Webinars. </strong>This is a format for managing a large audience (30+). There is a distinction between "panelists" and "attendees". The panelists have full video feed and audio input just like in a meeting. Attendees do not have a video stream for the panelists to see (because it can be overwhelming). They also cannot use audio unless explicitly granted permission from the host (or co-hosts - more than one person may host a webinar). The audience can interact with panelists via polls issued by the host OR via typing in text questions. </li>
</ul>
