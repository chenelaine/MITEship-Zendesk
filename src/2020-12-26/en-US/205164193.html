<h1>How many interviews do you need to build a good persona?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Primary Market Research</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Interview techniques</em><br><ul>
<li>If you don’t know what a persona is: Read <a href="http://www.harborlightpartners.com/resources">“Flat Stanley doesn’t live here” by Jennifer Doctor</a>.</li>
<li>If you don’t have a good first guess: Cast a wide net and have many short (15 minute) conversations with many more people (30-50) to help you come up with a tighter target.</li>
<li>Once you have a tight target: Interview 20-30 for each unique persona</li>
<li>For B2B you will need to interview many people with the same role per company as you will be able to get into many fewer companies than 20-30. </li>
