<h1>How do I make sure I am hiring the right people?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Human Resources</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Hiring</em><br><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Execution requires a great team.  </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimbaum"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Baum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a serial entrepreneur and investor in the Boston area, as well as a lecturer at MIT, has a cool mnemonic for the top five attributes to look for in a new hire:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<strong>E</strong> <strong>– Enthusiasm.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Look for people who are passionate, excited, and energized about the team they will be joining and the work they will be doing.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<strong>I – Intelligence. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for people who are smart and able to learn quickly.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<strong>E – Experience.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Look for people with the right experience base.  This one is tricky - more on this later.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<strong>I – Integrity.  </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for people who are honest and will do the right thing.  This one is immutable.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<strong>O – Organizational fit.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Look for people who are aligned with your values and culture. This is very important.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sums it up on the important things to look for, not only for hiring but for ongoing talent development.</span></p></body>
