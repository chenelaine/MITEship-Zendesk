<p>Following is the definition of the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p><em>"A <strong>non-disclosure agreement</strong> (<strong>NDA</strong>), also known as a <strong>confidentiality agreement</strong> (<strong>CA</strong>), <strong>confidential disclosure agreement</strong> (<strong>CDA</strong>), <strong>proprietary information agreement</strong> (<strong>PIA</strong>) or <strong>secrecy agreement</strong> (<strong>SA</strong>), is a <a title="Law" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law">legal</a> <a title="Contract" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract">contract</a> between at least two <a title="Party (law)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_(law)">parties</a> that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or <a title="Trade secret" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret">trade secrets</a>. As such, an NDA protects non-public business information.</em></p>
<p><em>NDAs are commonly signed when two companies, individuals, or other entities (such as partnerships, societies, etc.) are considering doing business and need to understand the processes used in each other's business for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship.</em><em>"</em></p></body>
