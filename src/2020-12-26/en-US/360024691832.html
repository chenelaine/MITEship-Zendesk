<h1>How do I estimate TAM if there is a HUGE range in what customers will pay?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Business Model and Pricing</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> TAM (Total Addressable Market)</em><br><p>If you are having difficulty estimating TAM because there is a huge range in the expected amount your users will pay - there are two possible reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>You have a wide range of product offering</strong>s each with different price points. If you are just getting started - that's a problem with focus. You probably need to prune the offerings and really find one solution that will delight your target market - and stick with that.</li>
<li>
<strong>You have a wide range of customers</strong> who differ wildly in their ability and willingness to pay. If that is the case, that is not a problem with the TAM estimation process, but is a symptom of you not having picked your beachhead market. Go back to the segmentation phase and review which market segment to go for first - define it tightly and the rest will follow.</li>
