<p><strong>Sales techniques </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is - test test test! Have a hypothesis. Know what you are testing and set a standard of what is a good/ bad outcome upfront.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cold call emails: write only three sentences:</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something about them – “I love the article that you posted about xxx”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something about you and your connection to them – “I reach out to you because I deal with this xxx and have some interesting points that might be relevant to you about yyyyy”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask an open ended, easy to answer question – “what’s the best way for us to connect for a 10 min conversation?”… </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask a question that cannot be answer with Y/N</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid do/is/would…</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open with Why/What/How…</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another tip: send it first to yourself and read it through your phone to make sure its short and concise!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you face a “gate keeper” that prevents you from connecting with someone, use the broader network.</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask other people in this network: “who’s the best person to talk to? What is the best way to reach out to this person?”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, reach out to this person and say: “xxx recommended that I reach out to yyyy.. What is the best way to get to yyyy?”</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for getting a meeting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn about the company. What do they care about? Read their 10K! Know what their problems are, do the research. Focus on the problem, not your solution.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offer to add value and demonstrate how others got value out of your product/ partnership</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask really good questions - ones that give you deeper understanding of their needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be afraid to qualify out.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% focus on getting the next step – is it an intro? Proposal?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on traction first, not scale. Only ones you get enough traction you can think about scale. </span></li>
