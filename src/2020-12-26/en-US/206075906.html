<h1>What are some common platforms for managing my email marketing campaigns?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Marketing and Sales</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> E-Marketing</em><br><p><a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constant Contact</a> and <a href="http://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailchimp </a>are two common services that can help you manage your email marketing campaigns.  Both allow you to manage different mailing lists, run campaigns, and look at quantifiable metrics relative to whether people opened your emails and/or clicked the links inside the emails. They are also great at automating list generations from email signups on web sites and mobile apps.</p>
