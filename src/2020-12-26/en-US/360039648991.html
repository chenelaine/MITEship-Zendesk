<h1>Are graphics or text more important in my digital advertising campaigns?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Marketing and Sales</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Online Advertising</em><br><p>90% of the information that comes to our brains is visual. It’s not the text of your ad that draws people’s attention - it is actually the images that bring people’s attention to your text. I recommend running multiple ads with different images but the same text content to determine which visuals are most effective.</p>
<p>The quality of your photos matters just as much the content of your ads. For ecommerce, 67% of people say the quality of a product image is “very important” in selecting and purchasing an item. The same goes for any type of digital advertising. </p>
