<h1>What do I need to know about Term Sheets?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - equity based</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Fund raising - overview</em><br><p><strong>Take-aways from a talk in the Trust Center on 8/9/16</strong></p>
<p><strong>Term sheets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contains many things that are there just for legacy reasons (boiler plate = something that you can say that was there for legacy reasons)</li>
<li>You only really need to focus on the economic and the control sections.</li>
<li>Term definitions – see slides: common stock, preferred stock, pre and post money</li>
<li>Negotiating term sheets
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Valuation negotiation</strong> don’t obsess only over this and remember that other terms might have really high monetary implications so give them enough attention</li>
<li>
<strong>Option pool - </strong>this is not split between you and the investor (comes out ONLY from the founders side and the founder gets diluted)
<ul>
<li>Typical A round: 15-20% (varies based on your hiring plan and future needs)</li>
<li>Make certain the option pool is a good fit for your company’s size/ stage. It’s a necessity so don’t cheap out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Vesting </strong>
<ul>
<li>Usually 3-4 Y term</li>
<li>Cliff: if you leave any time before the cliff you get nothing.</li>
<li>Upfront vesting – critical for founder.
<ul>
<li>Hard to get credit for part time/ student but for time you did full time you should get some credit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Important to have this even for founders so everyone is invested long term.</li>
<li>Acceleration – if you’ve had an exit you will get additional credit to incentivize you to stay post acquisition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>BOD</strong>
<ul>
<li>VCs will want to be on your BOD. They will usually be hands off from operations if it’s all going well and be more engaged in strategic decisions.</li>
<li>Thin: Do you want to be king or rich? Will impact your decisions.</li>
<li>Independent BOD members - Don’t give this decision to your VCs. You want to be a part of the selection so there isn’t a bias in decision making later on</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Other terms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Anti-dilution, veto control, preferred stocks perks… (see slides)</li>
</ul>
