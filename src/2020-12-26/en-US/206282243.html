<h1>What is the definition of scaling? </h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Scaling - Process and Infrastructure</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Scaling your team </em><br><p>Scaling is defined as spreading excellence according to Professor Robert Sutton (Stanford). You want to identify your pockets of excellent performance, attitude and execution and spread them throughout your organization. The best way to do this is to make people feel accountable for the success of your startup’s growth.</p>
<p>“There’s this feeling of ‘I own this place and this place owns me,’” says Sutton. “Everybody puts pressure on everybody else to do the right thing.”</p>
<p>Workplaces like this aren’t silent. People feel compelled to tell their colleagues when they’re screwing up, or to teach them and help them reach the same standards. Sutton gives IDEO as a prime example of an organization that has suffused its workplace with a commitment to high standards, reinforced by constant critiquing and short feedback loops.</p></body>
