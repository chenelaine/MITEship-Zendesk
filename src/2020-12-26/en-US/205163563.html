<h1>How do I keep track of all my business contacts?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> General questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Startup administrivia</em><br><p>The best way to do this is to rely on a customer relations management system (CRM).  Shared spreadsheets can get you started but you can rapidly run out of steam even in the first year - even if you are a solo-preneur.  The complexity starts to explode after you get beyond 50 contacts.</p>
<p>There are high end CRM systems and there are free ones.  <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubspot</a> has a free CRM tier that can be very helpful in the early days of a startup (and it may well be all that some small businesses will ever need, as it has reasonable feature sets for contact management, pipeline tracking and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zoho.com/crm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoho CRM</a> also provides a free solution that works to first level of approximation.  You can perform most basic tasks such as track your communications with a given contact, keep track of your prospects and run reports on closed sales and other sales metrics, provided you are ok with dealing with a rather spartan user experience.</p>
<p>You can always spring for salesforce.com when you are big enough.</p></body>
