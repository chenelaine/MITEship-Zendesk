<h1>How do I structure the first 3 pages of my SBIR proposal?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - Grants, prizes and accelerators</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Writing a great SBIR proposal</em><br><p>As mentioned before - be concise. The first 3 pages should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A REALLY GOOD abstract. Again, you are earning their attention with that first impression!</li>
<li>An Introduction section with subheadings. Make it easy for them to read and understand what you have to say.</li>
<li>In the introduction section, lay out theÂ following in subheadings: Problem; Technical solution; Team.</li>
<li>Make sure the Team section explains why your team has the strongest technical chops to fulfill the requirements of this project. If there are gaps in your technical team - fill the gap! For example, you might include an academic authority in an area you don't have expertise in - and explain that you will engage them as a consultant on this project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, make it EASY for them to navigate the first 3 pages. Give them the information they want quickly. Do not put equations in the first 3 pages!</p></body>
