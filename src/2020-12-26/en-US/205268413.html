<h1>How do I encourage people to take risks and share crazy ideas?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Ideation</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Brainstorming and ideation</em><br><p>For brainstorming to work, the participants have to take a little bit of personal risk.  Everything that one says may not all make sense or is well considered - that is the point.  Some people may hesitate to put forward ideas that are not perfectly formed. </p>
<p>If you know that there are some perfectionists who can become reticent in a blue sky brainstorming session, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en">Brene Brown's TED talk titled "The power of vulnerability"</a> might be just the thing to help participants relax and embrace not being right all of the time.</p>
<p>Another way to make it safe for brainstorming participants to contribute crazy ideas is to leverage the "yes, and" rule of improvisation. See <a href="https://orbit-kb.mit.edu/hc/en-us/articles/204963966" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> on how improv can help enforce the "no idea is a bad idea" ethos that helps make brainstorming sessions productive.</p></body>
