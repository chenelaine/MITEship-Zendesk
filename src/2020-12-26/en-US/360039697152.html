<h1>What is a Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) or business (SMB)?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship Overview</em><br><p>We define Small Medium Enterprises (SME) or businesses (SMB) as organizations that pursue opportunities focused on serving a local market. </p>
<p>SME's / SMB's have the following typical characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>They focus on addressing local markets only</li>
<li>They create “non-tradable jobs” – jobs that must be performed locally, e.g. restaurants, dry cleaners, service industry.</li>
<li>They are often family businesses. People who start them seek to maintain control, not to create high growth. Likely an individual-driven founder group.</li>
<li>The company generally grows at a linear rate. When investment is made into the company, the company (in terms of revenue) will respond quickly in a positive manner.</li>
</ul></body>
