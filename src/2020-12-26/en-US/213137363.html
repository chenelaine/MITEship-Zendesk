<h1>What do I need to know about fundraising / investment?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - equity based</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Fund raising - overview</em><br><p><strong>Take-aways on a talk in the Trust Center on 8/9/16 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Did you know? Early stage startups</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put effort in knowing your investors! Investors are not just a synonym for money. It makes a lot of difference who you choose.</li>
<li>Ways to raise early stage capital today: Angels, friends and family, grants, crowd funding, debt, customers, competitions, banks, VCs and more…
<ul>
<li>There are a lot of different flavors to each one, for example:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients- vendor financing</p>
<p>Crowd funding – lots of different platforms</p>
<ul>
<li>Half of the startups in the US exit after they get their seed. The ones who grow and make a difference also need to take the larger bet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investments through the life cycle of startups                                      </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Investment opportunities change over time
<ul>
<li>Early stage startups are the most crowded space. You have a lot of options for investments.</li>
<li>Investment trends change over time. Today, the seed stage is running much longer than in the past - you need to get more progress to get to round A</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Angels, VCs and bootstrapping</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Angels:</strong> individuals who invest out of their own check book. Are usually not able to follow on since their pockets are not deep enough</li>
<li>
<strong>VCs: </strong>Range across the “whole umbrella” (various stages/ rounds). Don’t invest their own money but rather money that comes out of a shared fund (institutional investors).</li>
<li>
<strong>Bootstrapping</strong>: Getting money without reaching out to external investors (grants, competitions, customers payments)
<ul>
<li>Non-dilutive = “free”. Your shares do not get diluted over time - grants, prizes. The only con for these types of money streams is that getting them is very time consuming… “Money value of time”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Convertible notes (debt)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This should not be your end game. You want to take convertible notes when you need to gain some cash quickly and in a simple way to fill specific gaps between raising priced rounds.
<ul>
<li>If you have time – invest in raising seed funds instead!</li>
<li>Priced rounds = Equity rounds (series seed/ A/B…)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is a loan, a promise to pay back money that someone gave you with stocks + interest instead of cash.
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to this commitment – don’t give away too much equity before even raising an A round</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Two main concepts </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Discount</strong>: an extra incentive for the investors that helps alleviate concerns around risky deals.</li>
<li>
<strong>Valuation cap</strong>: this is a concept that was raised since the note holder’s share was almost washed out completely when a priced round was closed.
<ul>
<li>Setting a very high valuation cap this might make it harder for you to raise funds later (depends on how strong your product is and how the market changes).</li>
<li>Setting a very low one gives the note holders an incentive to see you raise low valuation for future rounds because this way they suffer less dilution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You’ll need to negotiate both the discount and the valuation cap to get money from the note holder. As a note holder you don’t get both but you most likely will choose the better out of the two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Selling your company or bankrupting before raising series A funds </strong></li>
<li>With Bankruptcy, convertible notes are just another line of obligation you have to your lenders (and will most likely will just be wiped out)</li>
<li>If you sell your company, there’s no one clear way that the market deals with it. There will be a formula set in advance between you and the note holder depends on projections you make.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Surprising facts about early stage VC investments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s all about relationships! The human being connection is extremely important and much more important than you can ever expect.</li>
<li>The amount of money is not that big: Don’t expect all deals to be unicorns. $6B total a year is raised across the US</li>
<li>Late stage financing does not usually come from VCs: 87% of the money that goes to unicorns in that stage comes from PE/ public investors (VCs can’t afford it)</li>
<li>Learn to give up some control: when you raise funds from outside investors you company is no longer 100% yours so you need to accept it!</li>
<li>You’re not just “paying” to get money: Giving up control is also for getting guidance, networking, and credibility. As a CEO, you need someone to make your job less lonely. All of these are not on the term sheet but are added values</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do VCs make their money?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a very ritualized process:
<ul>
<li>you pitch</li>
<li>there is a decision made behind locked doors: decision making process varies but needs to be a decision of the firm and not just individual</li>
<li>you receive a term sheet: this shouldn’t be a surprise, you should discuss the terms in advance with your potential investors</li>
<li>financing documentations are processed: lawyers included</li>
<li>sign up and close: sometime the money is received upon achieving milestones</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who are the VCs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There isn’t that much diversity in this community.</li>
<li>Very rare for an individual partner to close more than a couple deals a year.</li>
<li>Investors put ~1% of the company’s total fund when closing a deal.
<ul>
<li>Limited partners: they will put in 98%-99% of the money and the VCs will kick in the remaining 1%.the LP will be able to attract investments from other funds as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do the VCs make their money</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IRR = internal rate of return (this is a rate of return with a time component to it)</li>
<li>2% fees and 20% carry are what VCs get
<ul>
<li>Fees- % VC gets of the total funds size, regardless of the deals they close</li>
<li>Carry- the VCs split on the profit from return on investments. LPs will get 80% and the VCs get the remaining 20% and split it.</li>
<li>It’s usually 1-2 deals that will make the profit out for the entire fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
