<h1>What is the difference between intrapreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship Overview</em><br><p>Actually, there is no difference - these words mean the same things!</p>
<p>We prefer "Corporate Entrepreneurship" only because we believe the word "Entrepreneurship" most closely describes the spirit and mindset of corporate leaders who are leading the charge in building or investing in new ventures within their organization.</p></body>
