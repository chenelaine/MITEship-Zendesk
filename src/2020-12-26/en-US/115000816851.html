<h1>Who reviews SBIR proposals?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - Grants, prizes and accelerators</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Applying for an SBIR or STTR grant</em><br><p>Generally, SBIR proposals are reviewed by a committee at the federal agency where the solicitation came from. In short - they are not read by people from the Small Business Administration (SBA) which oversees the SBIR program. </p>
<p>The committee typically includes the following types of reviewers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsor point of contact (who works in a lab inside the federal agency that released teh solicitation)</li>
<li>Academics</li>
<li>Government lab researchers </li>
<li>Corporate researchers in industry</li>
<li>Other technically competent people in the community</li>
</ul>
<p>Given several of the reviewers are likely not working directly in your field, you will need to work hard to make the first 3 pages of your proposal interesting and comprehensible while not making it condescending. The subsequent sections should be technical but draw from context provided in the first 3 pages. It's a fine line and it is always worth investing in making the proposal human-readable. Budget at least 2 weeks to write the proposal so you can test it out with other people and iterate.</p></body>
