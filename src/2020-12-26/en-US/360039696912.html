<h1>Who creates the innovation strategy for an organization?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Innovation Strategy in Corporations</em><br><p>The actual innovation strategy is often developed by either the innovation chief with support from staff (as was the case at the International Monetary Fund and at Coca-Cola HBC, a major bottler of Coca-Cola in Europe), or by an internal strategy team (as was the case in a few projects at Dell EMC), or in some cases it may be co-created by an internal team working with a management consulting firm (as was the case with Save the Children US and Boston Consulting Group).</p></body>
