<h1>What is entrepreneurship?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship Overview</em><br><p>The <a href="https://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/Entrepreneurship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webster Dictionary</a> defines the word "Entrepreneurship" as <strong>the activity of organizing, managing, and assuming the risks of a business enterprise.</strong></p>
<p>It is important note that entrepreneurship is far more than just startups. Entrepreneurship happens in the context of standalone startups (whether they raise external capital or not), in non-profits, in large and small established businesses, in government and the military.
