<h1>How many people apply for each SBIR solicitation?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - Grants, prizes and accelerators</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Applying for an SBIR or STTR grant</em><br><p>This is just a guideline and the numbers can vary wildly between solicitations. That said, generally, the funnel looks like this:Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of proposals are submitted to each solicitation</li>
<li>About 15% are selected to receive a Phase 1 SBIR award (typically in the 100-150k range - covering research for 6-9 months)</li>
<li>Of the Phase 1 awardees, some will be invited to submit a Phase 2 SBIR proposal. Typically 40-50% of the Phase 1 awardees will go on to a Phase 2 award.</li>
</ul></body>
