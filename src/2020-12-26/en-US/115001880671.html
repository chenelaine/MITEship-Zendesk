<h1>What do investors need to know about the startup to invest?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - equity based</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Raising an angel or seed round</em><br><p>Typically, investors who are not completely naive will need to know the following things:</p>
<p>Litmus test questions:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a GREAT team? A team that works well together, has the requisite skillset, and the grit to overcome obstacles and figure it out together when they encounter hardships?</li>
<li>Is it a big enough idea with a big enough market?</li>
<li>Are they working on an idea that fits in with our investment thesis?</li>
</ul>
<p>Nuts and bolts questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much are you raising? (huge range from a couple tens of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars)</li>
<li>How long will this last? (Typically 12-18 months. Any less- and you will be hugely distracted constantly raising money and not getting stuff done)</li>
<li>What do they get with this money? This is the business and strategic milestones they expect to see. For instance. Stuff that fits and obviously cost money:
<ul>
<li>Build out the sales and marketing department to power the direct sales organization for enterprise sales</li>
<li>Acquire ABC customers in certain time frames (e.g. pilot, full rollout, etc; seat count, other measures of scope and scale)</li>
<li>Build out tech functionality to support the acquisition of ABC customers</li>
<li>Strategic hire for e.g. a Chief Something Officer to round out the leadership team</li>
<li>… etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you intend to run the business to arrive at the above milestones?
<ul>
<li>Think about the org chart. How will you organize the humans to do the work?</li>
<li>Think about the program plan. What is the working approach? How do you break down tasks and work? What resources do you need (headcount, license fees, equipment etc)?</li>
<li>Think about the operating plan. How are you spending this money and how fast
<ul>
<li>For a software company this typically shows up in headcount and consulting fees if applicable.</li>
<li>For regulated industries like healthcare and financial applications, add consulting fees and testing fees to arrive at regulatory compliance</li>
<li>For a hardware company, add consulting, prototyping costs, and any tooling costs ( if applicable and not covered with a separate line of credit or venture debt)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are the terms for the promissory note?
<ul>
<li>What is the discount?</li>
<li>What is the valuation cap if any?</li>
<li>What is the maturity date if any?</li>
<li>What are the provisions upon an exit event such as an acquisition prior to maturity date?</li>
<li>What are the provisions if the company does not raise a round within the maturity period of the loan?</li>
<li>… etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
