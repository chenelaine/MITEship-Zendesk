<h1>What are some common patterns in startup business models?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Business Model and Pricing</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Determining your Business Model</em><br><p>In general, startups should think of business models that maximizes the lifetime value (LTV) for each customer they acquire - as well as business models that helps to create some level of predictability and repeatability.</p>
<p>For this reason, one-and-done strategies where you acquire a customer, they pay you once and you never see them again, is going to be very difficult - it can work if the transaction is very large in size and scope and you have a trained sales force to go after them in a direct sales strategy. This can be very difficult to sustain if you are attempting to sell products at a modest price to consumers.</p>
<p>In that case, you would be well advised to think about how you can come up with a recurring revenue stream, because that means you can predict a certain level of continuing revenue once you acquire a customer. For hardware products, if you can sell consumables, that's a classic way to generate a recurring revenue stream. For software products, subscription in a SaaS model is typical.</p>
<p>Anything can be made into a subscription. For example, if you sell pistachios, you can sell them in one or two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<strong>One and done</strong>. Your customer goes to the store and buys the pistachios and pays for it on the spot.  This is what you do at a grocery store, or indeed at any retail outlet.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<strong>Subscription</strong> - Your customer signs up to get periodic refills of the pistachios.  This is what you do if you go on <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> and try to buy some pistachios.  Oftentimes you will be offered two choices: You can either do the one time payment, or you can save money by subscribing. </div>
</li>
</ul>
