<h1>How do you get the team to buy into your mindset? </h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Scaling - Process and Infrastructure</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Scaling your team </em><br><p>A good example from Robert Sutton (Stanford) is Facebook. “Right when they start, new engineers are encouraged to make changes in the code that they could point out to their mother or father," Sutton says. That's the "move fast and break things" mindset in action. By expecting this behavior, Facebook leadership is able to scale the belief that everyone should be working fast and making an impact. </p>
<p>But one mindset definitely doesn’t fit all.</p>
<p>Sutton also interviewed an executive at VMWare, and when he asked whether they move fast and break things, the answer was an emphatic “no.” “They build software for nuclear submarines. Everything has to be right,” Sutton explains. In this case, the devotion to precision was communicated as a common mindset that would help the company scale.</p></body>
