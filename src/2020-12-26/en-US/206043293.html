<h1>Is software patentable?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Legal </em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Intellectual Property Protection</em><br><p>I like to say, “software is <u>not not</u> patentable.” No, that’s not a typo. When someone makes that assertion, they are highlighting their misunderstanding of patent law. Yes, some software is not patentable, but a lot of software is patentable. Yes, it has become more difficult and less certain since 2014, but the law still is unsettled, so a strong opinion of whether a certain software invention is patentable or not patentable is probably hard to make. I frequently secure patents to software-related inventions!</p>
