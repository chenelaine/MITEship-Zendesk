<h1>How long should it take to develop a product?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Product Development</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Planning projects</em><br><p>First of all, there is no single answer.  It depends on the industry (whether it is regulated / whether there are compliance requirements), product type (hardware, software, bio/pharma, construction/building based, other), and complexity (for example, consumer electronics products have a huge range in complexity from a powerpoint clicker to toys to computers and mobile devices to small kitchen appliances and more).</p>
<p>That said, there are some order of magnitude references that can be useful. As of 2015, here are some general guidelines for "what's reasonable".</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile apps – no science: 0-3 months </li>
<li>Web apps – no science: 0-3 months</li>
<li>Web apps, big data science: 3-6 months+</li>
<li>Embedded software releases (e.g. firmware running on a car): 6-9 months after the hardware is stable</li>
<li>Small scale mass produced consumer electronics products : 9-12 months (e.g. a new tablet)</li>
<li>Complex industrial equipment with mechanisms: 12-36 months (e.g. Tesla S)</li>
<li>New drug: 12-18 years</li>
</ul></body>
