<h1>What is a "SAFE note"?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - equity based</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Convertible notes and safe notes</em><br><p>A safe note is a way to structure early investment rounds at the angel and seed stage before a properly priced equity round. It is an alternative to "convertible notes". YCombinator partner and lawyer Carolyn levy invented this new financial instrument in 2013 to improve upon the convertible note.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/announcing-the-safe-a-replacement-for-convertible-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definition of the safe note according to YCombinator</a>.</p>
<p>"A safe is like a convertible note in that the investor buys not stock itself but the right to buy stock in an equity round when it occurs.  A safe can have a valuation cap, or be uncapped, just like a note.  But what the investor buys is not debt, but something more like a warrant.  So there is no need to fix a term or decide on an interest rate."</p>
