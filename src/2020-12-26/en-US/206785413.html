<h1>What is customer service?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Scaling - Process and Infrastructure</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Customer service</em><br><p>Customer service spans the whole gamut from very low touch approaches (such as the self-help knowledge base portals commonly associated with self-service SaaS-based businesses) to very high touch approaches (in which there is a dedicated client manager who interfaces with customers for any and every issue and concern).</p>
