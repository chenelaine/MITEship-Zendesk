<h1>Can I pay my employees in equity and not in cash?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Legal </em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Everything about stock and stock options</em><br><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>You can create an option pool and you should create an option pool – all equity grants should be made from the option pool to employees (non founders) and subject to a restricted stock grant agreement (with vesting, etc).</p>
<p>BUT you cannot pay in just equity – labor laws are going to step in on the analysis, people need to be paid wages.</p></body>
