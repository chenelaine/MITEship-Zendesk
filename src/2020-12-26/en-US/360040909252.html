<h1>How do we stay on topic and organized within an instant messaging platform?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Anti-Fragility in the face of crisis</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> How to use technology to help us go virtual</em><br><p>Instant Messaging (IM) platforms such as Slack, Hipchat, Skype chat and a host of other options have features to help teams separate their work brain from their silly brain. This is another area where virtual tools can provide a better experience than in-person interactions. For example, I am currently working with a team that has the following chat rooms:</p>
<ul>
<li>General</li>
<li>Program planning</li>
<li>Market sizing and analysis</li>
<li>Product definition</li>
<li>Control nerding (my personal favorite)</li>
</ul>
