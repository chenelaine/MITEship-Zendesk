<h1>What do I need to know about operating expenses?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Basics of Finance (i.e. managing money)</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Getting started with your financial scoreboard</em><br><p>The operating expenses summarize how you spend money to operate the business. When creating a budget for a startup, it is helpful to group expenses into departments. For example, a typical technology startup might have four types of expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Product and Engineering</strong> (e.g. product management; hardware engineering; software development; data science / AI / ML; quality assurance; devOps; R&amp;D; etc)</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing and sales</strong> (e.g. brand marketing; lead generation and qualification; selling expenses; etc)</li>
<li>
<strong>Operations</strong> (e.g. server costs for software companies; prototyping/parts costs for hardware companies; etc)</li>
<li>
<strong>General &amp; administrative</strong> (e.g. HR; finance; IT; etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>For a startup, the #1 expense is almost always people costs (whether they are full time employees or contractors). </p>
<p>Hardware startups also has significant prototyping costs, tooling costs, and sometimes they need to incur significant non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs as well. </p>
<p>Software startups tend to be more cash-efficient in that their expenses tend to be low (e.g. monthly payments to cloud based services to host their software and support their software development environment).</p>
