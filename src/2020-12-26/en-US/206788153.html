<h1>How do hardware businesses handle customer service?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Scaling - Process and Infrastructure</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Customer service</em><br><p>How a hardware company handles customer care entirely depends on the cost structure and end user of the product.</p>
<p>On one extreme, consumer electronics products are purchased and used by consumers.  If the cost is low (for instance, below $300 per unit), the customer care approach is often similar to that of self-help SaaS based software products - customers are directed first to 24/7 self-help portals to see if a knowledgebase or a community forum answers their questions. If that doesn't work, they can call a customer support line.  A tiered service strategy is often used to manage time demands for highly skilled technical personnel. </p>
<p>If the product doesn't work or is damaged, they are often shipped back to the manufacturer, and if the cost of manufacture is low enough, the customer usually receives a new replacement unit because the cost of fixing their product exceeds the cost of manufacturing a whole new unit.  The defective unit can then go back to engineering for root cause analysis.</p>
<p>On the other extreme, industrial automation products are purchased by managers and other higher ranking decision makers and used by skilled or non-skilled operators.  When something goes wrong, the product is usually not shippable (imagine having a 5-axis CNC machine stop working).  The only option is often to send out a field service team to diagnose and fix the problem on site.  This is very costly and usually the customer will need to purchase a field service plan or pay out of pocket each time the equipment fails. </p>
<p>The exception is when a very high value product is placed - such as a traditional industrial robot - in which the integrator (a company that resells the robot and then performs months of integration to get the robot up and running) will provide a warranty and will execute a service level agreement that often specifies the maximum response time for a field crew to show up on site. </p>
<p>When the cost of the equipment going down is extreme (such as in the case of factory automation) the provider for field service can potentially be charged a penalty for every hour that the equipment stays down.  This type of business usually drives the service provider to sell the customer a preventative maintenance plan so problems are prevented instead of handled.</p></body>
