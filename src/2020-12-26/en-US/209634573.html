<h1>I am a foreign student founder. What are the visa options open to me?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> For international students</em><br><p>As of January, 2020: Many student founders who are just graduating start with applying for <a href="http://iso.mit.edu/immigration/emp_f1_opt.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optional Practical Training (OPT)</a>.  Those in STEM fields are eligible to pursue the <a href="http://iso.mit.edu/immigration/emp_f1_stem_opt.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one time STEM OPT extension</a>. See <a href="https://orbit-kb.mit.edu/hc/en-us/articles/209634403-I-am-a-foreign-founder-Can-I-legally-continue-to-work-on-my-startup-in-the-US-after-graduation-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this other FAQ article</a> for more information on OPT and STEM OPT Extension or <a href="http://iso.mit.edu/immigration/employment.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit the MIT International Student Office's employment page</a> for details.</p>
<p>Once student founders are on OPT they often simultaneously begin the process of applying for a work visa.  Visa rules change frequently and we strongly recommend that you work with an attorney who specializes in immigration issues to understand your options.  Visit the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/employment/temporary-worker-visas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Department of State's web page on employment visas</a> for details.  Many of our previous student founders have looked into either the H1-B or the O categories of temporary work visas.  However, as mentioned, the rules change frequently so do consult legal counsel who specializes in immigration law for advice. </p>
<p>For student founders who have an extraordinary ability or are outstanding professors or researchers, they may be eligible for an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">employment-based, first preference visa called the EB-1</a>.   The bar is high for this path. Consult an immigration lawyer to see if this is an option that might be open to you.</p>
