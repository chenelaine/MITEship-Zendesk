<h1>What are some common mistakes in financials for first time founders?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Basics of Finance (i.e. managing money)</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Getting started with your financial scoreboard</em><br><p><font size="2" color="black" face="Tahoma"><span dir="ltr" style="font-size: 10pt;">On pricing and unit economics:<br></span></font></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;">
<li>They undervalue their offerings and charge too little - leaving money on the table.</li>
<li>They don't hack their unit economics - losing money in every sale (this is fine in the short term but very not fine in the long term.)</li>
<li>They don't think about lifetime value (LTV) properly and don't think about how to extract the most money from each acquired customer.</li>
<li>They underestimate the cost of customer acquisition (COCA), resulting in a poor lifetime value to cost of customer acquisition ratio over time (LTV/COCA) which usually starts high, but MUST come down to at least a 3:1 ratio over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>On forecasting:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;">
<li>In forecasting revenue, they overestimate the speed at which they will acquire customers</li>
<li>In forecasting revenue, they overestimate the number of years customers will stay with them In recurring revenue models ("Our customers will stay with us for the remainder of their lives")</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On costs / operating plan:</div>
<ul style="margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;">
<li>When calculating costs, especially for hardware companies, they are usually 10x to 100x off on what they think it takes to bring something to market.</li>
<li>They tend to be grossly unrealistic in timelines for (a) product dev esp for hw companies (b) go to market ramp time esp for sw companies</li>
<li>They usually have no idea what organization structure is needed / biz partnerships to pursue to get the job done consequently cost structure is artificially favorable</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to manage around these common mistakes is to go over financial projections with a seasoned, trusted advisor who has built financial scoreboards for startups of the same type before.  A little feedback early on can go a long way to helping founders come up with a strategy that works.</p>
