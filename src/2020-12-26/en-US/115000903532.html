<p>We have also heard about some accelerators for student entrepreneurs, some of which are backed by Venture Capital (VC) firms. While these are great resources for students, know that you may run into a signaling issue if you go through an accelerator backed by a specific VC, and then you end up not raising money from them. This could be perceived as a flag by other potential investors. </p>
