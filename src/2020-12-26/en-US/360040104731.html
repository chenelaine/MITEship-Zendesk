<h1>Who is involved in major investment decisions in support of the innovation strategy?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Innovation Strategy in Corporations</em><br><p>The innovation strategy for an organization is typically developed at the senior leadership level, typically at the C-suite, although VPs and General Managers of divisions and regions are often involved as well. The C-suite executives (especially the Chief Innovation Officer, if there is one, in conjunction with the Chief Strategy Officer and the CEO) are charged with the task of coming up with innovation strategies that align well with the overall corporate strategy. They are the people who will ultimately make decisions about a multi-year capital allocation plan to invest in innovation and entrepreneurship within the organization.</p>
