<h1>What is innovation-driven entrepreneurship (IDE)?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship Overview</em><br><p>According to Professor Bill Aulet of MIT, innovation driven entrepreneurship (IDE) is defined as the pursuit of opportunities focused on products or repeatable services beyond the local market.</p>
<p>IDEs have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>They focus on super regional or global markets. The company is based on some sort of innovation (tech, business process, model) where they can go global or across regions.</li>
<li>They create “Tradable jobs” – jobs that do not have to be performed locally.</li>
<li>They typically have a more diverse ownership base as the focus of founders is on high growth and realizing financial returns. Founders tend to be more team-oriented.</li>
<li>The company starts by investing time, effort &amp; resources, but in time will have exponential growth. When investment is made into the company, the revenue does not respond as quickly as in small and medium enterprises.</li>
