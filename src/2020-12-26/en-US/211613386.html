<h1>What should a founder’s agreement include dependent on the stage of the company?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Legal </em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Founder's Agreement</em><br><p><strong>Take-aways from a talk in the Trust Center on 7/14/16</strong></p>
<p><strong>Different stages of your company require different founders agreements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some examples include:</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-incorporation FA</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post- incorporation (“Day 1”) FA</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity allocation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors/ shareholder agreement</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pre-incorporation FA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every individual owns his own work and the IP for it until they assign it to the company or the company is incorporated</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When VCs think about investing in your company they do their due diligence to avoid any legal risks, IP risks and others. They will want to make sure you have IP assignments from everyone who ever worked with you before they make the financial commitment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This FA should include:</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A section specifying that there is a company that will be formed and all IP will be owned by the company to be. (signed by all team members – paid and unpaid)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expectations for equity split from the future entity (even if there isn’t real equity yet.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information about IP laws categories– see IP session take-aways from XX/XX</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post-incorporation (“Day 1”) FA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This FA should include:</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IP assignment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are the shareholders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is on the board</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting with your shares (to maintain this board designation)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amendment provision:</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People are signing this agreement in day 1 but it is actually effective for many years later (And binding even if you leave the company!)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allowing for amendments gives your company the flexibility in case people with voting rights leave so majority of the shareholders is enough to make decisions.</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titles- who are the directors. This is very important as directors are allowed to decide on shares, fire people and make other critical decisions. They later assign the officers, treasurer and president.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the decision making process?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is going be on the board?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares split</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity issuance</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best practice: start with an equal split as a baseline and then think: is there a reason to divert from this? Adjust based on these factors (for example: the idea generator/ the amount of past work/ future commitment /engagement…)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no right answer! Sit down in a room </span><strong>without</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your lawyers, advisors. Come up with an agreement among the team members and leave it as is. Team discussion is 95% of the process. You will not figure out all the remaining 5% and will take all of your energy and time – not worth it!</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prepare for this discussion with your team, you need to be able to answer:</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IP, what was your intellectual contribution</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time you spent in this project</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time you plan to spend in the future</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens if someone leaves?</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best practice – make sure all shares are under vesting: members earn their equity over time. They get everything immediately so if the company is sold they can keep it but if they leave before the end of the vesting period they needs to give it back.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typical vesting period – 3-5 years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorized share vs issued shares: If someone leaves, the shares he gives back return to company and resume the status of authorized but not issued. Issued shares are owned by the company. Unissued shares are not owned by the company. If more shares are issued to more people than the overall pool l of issued shares are shared by more people- individual shares are diluted.</span></li>
