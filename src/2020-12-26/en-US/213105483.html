<h1>Are you a feature, Product or Company ?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Product Development</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Planning projects</em><br><p><strong>Creating a feature, product or a company</strong></p>
<p>These are completely different things</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature - you have a certain IP / technology you developed and can try to license it</li>
<li>Product- you now control your own destiny. Can potentially make 100X than just licensing the feature, and can sell it to another a company to complete their products portfolio</li>
<li>Company –with a company, you can extract 10X- 1MX! You can expand and develop your own product portfolio</li>
</ul>
<p>What determines whether you’ll end up w a feature/ product/ company is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your passion – the team must be willing to commit to the amount of risk and effort that a company takes</li>
<li>Your core - the enabling capability that will allow you to create benefit</li>
</ul>
