<h1>Gauging customer interest and purchase intent using landing page tests</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Primary Market Research</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Product and usability research</em><br><p>In today’s fast-changing world, new product teams are constantly pushed to <a class="ext-link" title="" href="http://www.amazon.com/Do-More-Faster-TechStars-Accelerate/dp/0470929839/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">do more faster</a>. They need to run fast to keep up with rapidly changing market conditions. Oftentimes it means making decisions about what to invest in with very little information. How can teams validate hypotheses without over-investing on speculative engineering projects, and potentially losing time and money building the wrong thing?</p>
<p>It turns out that there is another way. In both B2B and B2C scenarios, you can often get a very good read on the interest and even purchase intent from potential economic buyers by running a series of landing page tests.</p>
<p><em>What is a landing page test?<br></em><br>A landing page test is a form of Minimum Viable Product (MVP) test, in which one uses a landing page as a way of gauging some aspect of customer interest and/or purchase intent.</p>
<p>While you can gather a tremendous amount of insight by running detailed, open-ended interviews with potential customers, at the end of the day you are still limited by what the customer thinks they will do, instead of what they will actually do. Purchase intent is frequently inflated when you test your product idea with people face to face, because they are often loath to hurt your feelings by telling you the truth. It’s emotionally much easier to just say “yes, this is very interesting!” or “Sure! I will certainly buy it!” rather than “you are talking to the wrong person – I have no interest whatsoever.” </p>
<p>The landing page test is a way to pose the same questions while getting away from the subjectiveness of the spoken word, and moving to the objectiveness of observable behaviors. In a landing page test, you can present your product concept as if it exists – and then put in a simple call to action: a large button that says nothing but “Learn more,” “Sign me up,” or “Buy now.”</p>
