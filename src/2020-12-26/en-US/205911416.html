<h1>What is the #1 job of the CEO?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Basics of Finance (i.e. managing money)</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Getting started with your financial scoreboard</em><br><p>There are many posts that define the job of the startup CEO. They are ALL different.</p>

<li>
<a href="Inc%20Magazine%20says%20the%20startup%20CEO's%20#1%20job%20is%20to%20generate%20positive%20energy." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inc Magazine</a> says the startup CEO's #1 job is to generate energy into their company.</li>
