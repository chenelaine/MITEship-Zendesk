<h1>I have taken some entrepreneurship classes. Will this be repetitive?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT Fuse - 3-week mini accelerator during IAP (January)</em><br><p>No. First of all, fuse is a hands-on experience where you will spend most of your time working on your venture - not sitting in a classroom listening to lectures.  Secondly, fuse follows the Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework which is taught in a number of entrepreneurship classes.  While the framework and topics remain the same, the way we will cover these topics in the accelerator will be very different than the treatment in a classroom. Rather than repeating the lectures, we will rely on facilitated discussions, case-based discussions and practical workshops to dive deep into what each topic means in the context of the venture that you are working on during StartIAP.  Sessions will be highly interactive, and startup teams will be actively participating in, and contributing to, the conversation.</p></body>
