<h1>What is core?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Team Building: Leadership, Management and Culture</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Development of Culture</em><br><p>The core is the defensible kernel of your company that you will defend at all costs.</p>
<p>The core needs to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Unique</strong>: something you can do better than anyone else</li>
<li>
<strong>Grows:</strong> over time</li>
<li>
<strong>Important</strong>: ties directly to your quantified value proposition and what customer care about. You need to have motes to help you get to your core – IP for example could be a good thing to buy you time to develop your core.</li>
</ul>
