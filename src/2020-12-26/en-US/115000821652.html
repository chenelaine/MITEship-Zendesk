<h1>What is the NSF I-Corps Program? </h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Sector Deep Dives</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Tough Tech / Deep Tech</em><br><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) has an excellent program called I-Corps that is designed to help scientists learn how to commercialize their inventions. </p>
<p>The official NSF I-Corps site describes this program as follows:</p>
<p><em>"The National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps program prepares scientists and engineers to extend their focus beyond the university laboratory, and accelerates the economic and societal benefits of NSF-funded, basic-research projects that are ready to move toward commercialization.</em></p>
<p><em>Through I-Corps, NSF grantees learn to identify valuable product opportunities that can emerge from academic research, and gain skills in entrepreneurship through training in customer discovery and guidance from established entrepreneurs."</em></p>
