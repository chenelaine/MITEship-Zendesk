<h1>How do I put up a web page quickly to run digital experiments?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Primary Market Research</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Getting started</em><br><p>If you want to test customer interest in your idea via a landing page, and want to maximize learnings and minimize time spent building the landing page, there are a few options.</p>
<p>1. If you want to rapidly build out a website, the easiest thing is one of the wysiwig platforms. Examples: Squarespace, Wix, Weebly. Squarespace costs money, other two cost less money if you are ok with the URL showing their domain (URL forwarding will take a little more time and/or money). For email capture: All of the above have embedded forms. That said - you can also embed URL from Google Forms or Typeform. The latter is quite full featured and we use it for a lot of programs.</p>
<p>2. If you want to run real experiments (e.g. A/B testing, multivariate) and want to quantify funnel metrics and also run an email campaign out of the same platform, <a href="http://unbounce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unbounce.com</a> or <a href="http://quickmvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickmvp.com</a> are good bets. <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optimizely</a> is a good platform for A/B testing as well.</p>
