<h1>How many people can be on my team?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT deltav</em><br><p>Teams must have between two and five members that are all founder-level participants. If you have other people working on the project (interns, etc.), that is okay, but don’t include them on your application. We also cannot at this time guarantee office space for individuals other than your MIT delta v core team members. </p></body>
