<h1>Next Step Prototypes?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Product Development</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Prototyping</em><br><p>I will pick up from the point that you have your target market and have done meaningful market research.  Then you develop as good a prototype as possible with your available resources. Building a prototype can be the first expensive step in your product development.  You may need some investments to pay for your prototype. </p>
<p>Family and friends are often the best place to start for some small investments. Some of them may already know about your product, maybe have been encouraging you, and now may be the time to ask for some investments. As Bill Aulet has repeatedly stated you want to be upfront about the risk of investing in a new product, especially if you hope to keep good relations with your family and friends.</p></body>
