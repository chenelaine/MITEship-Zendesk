<h1>What if every conversation with a new interview subject is a whole new conversation?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Primary Market Research</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Interview techniques</em><br><p>There are two possible reasons why each conversation feels like a new conversation.</p>
<p><strong>1. You are at the very beginning of a problem selection and segmentation exercise.</strong></p>
<p>You are casting a very wide net - talking to 30, 40, 50 people in many hypothetical segments. What you are doing is to "boil the ocean" and use the interviews to help you understand how people self-organize, and help you create the right behavioral segments for your new venture.</p>
<p>In that case, it is good that you are hearing new things - that means you are still learning where your segment boundaries lie. Keep doing it until clear patterns emerge.</p>
<p><strong>2. You are well past segmentation and beachhead market selection and believe you are interviewing to build a tight persona.</strong></p>
<p>You are interviewing a carefully curated list of people, and yet you hear very different things in areas where you expect shared needs and wants. In that case: What this means is that your targeting is either too broad, or you have created a hypothetical segment and persona that does not quite match how your potential customers see themselves.</p>
<p>Step back and ask yourself how else you can sub-segment your target market to tighten it up. See if you can have lots of short conversations with lots more people to help you sub-segment. You will probably end up having several tighter targets, each sharing more nuanced attributes with each other. Now you can recruit a few people per target and look for the sweet spot.</p></body>
