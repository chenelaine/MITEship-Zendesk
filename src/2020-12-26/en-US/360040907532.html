<h4>Teaching tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>Err on the side of having a powerpoint presentation so people can follow along</li>
<li>Less case discussion, more interactive lecture and breakout activities</li>
<li>Plan out the activities and distribute materials ahead of time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audience engagement tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set expectations of how we would like the audience to engage ahead of time</li>
<li>The audience should have their cameras on if bandwidth permits</li>
<li>Expect more comments than normal since people can type</li>
<li>Allow people to type questions through chat</li>
<li>Rather than take questions along the way, stop explicitly and address questions</li>
<li>Batch up the questions and answer them in between delivering the lecture</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technology and audience management tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assign a designated virtual moderator other than the speaker to manage and monitor audience engagement and questions submitted</li>
<li>Create an alternative real time coordination mechanism for speakers/presenters/moderators to communicate outside the virtual conferencing platform</li>
<li>Consider using two screens – one for powerpoint screen sharing, the other for showing the audience in grid view</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Group work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When doing group breakouts, every group should assign 1 person responsible for reporting</li>
<li>Use Google Slides – have the group edit slides then present to class</li>
<li>Use breakout feature</li>
</ul></body>
