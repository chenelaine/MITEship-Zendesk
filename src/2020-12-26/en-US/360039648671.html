<h1>How do I plan my advertising campaign?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Marketing and Sales</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Online Advertising</em><br><p>When you’re ready to get started it’s important to put together a plan. You should have a daily or weekly plan depending on the size of your budget and timeline for results. In either case you should have time set aside each week to review the results and plan new optimizations. Your plan should include goals, platform, audience targeting, content &amp; media, a budget, metrics, and your schedule. For each period you should choose what you want to test in order to de-risk your business.</p>
