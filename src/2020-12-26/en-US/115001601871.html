<h1>How do I storyboard my pitch?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Pitching, Presentations and Public Speaking</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Preparing for a talk</em><br><p>Contrary to common practice, the best pitches don't start with creating slides - they start with constructing a storyboard that connects all the key talking points in the pitch into one coherent narrative. One method is to use sticky notes to help facilitate this process.</p>
