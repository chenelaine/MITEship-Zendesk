<ul>
<li>Your custom URL redirecting to a landing page that explains the basic founding premise (or not) - there are many startups whose landing page simply says "coming soon".</li>
<li>A Twitter handle </li>
<li>A LinkedIn page</li>
<li>A Facebook Page, if Facebook is relevant for your target market</li>
<li>An Instagram account, if IG is relevant for your target market</li>
<li>A Snapchat account, if Snapchat is relevant for your target market</li>
</ul>
