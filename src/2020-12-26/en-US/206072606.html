<h1>I don't have any startup experience. Can I still be a founder?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Career Choice</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Deciding whether to start a company</em><br><p>Absolutely.  While many founders are serial entrepreneurs, or have worked in a startup setting before becoming a founder, there are just as many who jump into entrepreneurship with both feet having never worked in that situation before.  There is always a first time for everyone. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The good news is that there are many resources to help a first time founder get started. Entrepreneurial hubs like Boston, the Bay Area, Austin, Boulder and so forth have healthy startup ecosystems full of programs and events to help you acquire new skills, and to meet highly qualified people who are willing and available to help while asking nothing in return. If you are a first time founder: Don’t be shy – lean on this support system. You will be surprised at how much free consulting you can get if you only asked.</p>
