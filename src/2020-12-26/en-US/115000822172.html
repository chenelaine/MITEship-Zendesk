<h1>What is the deliverable for a Phase 1 award?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - Grants, prizes and accelerators</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Phase 1 and Phase 2 SBIR / STTR Awards</em><br><p>A Phase 1 award typically requires a written report and a working prototype at the conclusion of the project.
