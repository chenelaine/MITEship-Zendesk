<h1>How do you do pricing research in a detailed interview?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Testing your MVP and Finding Product/Market Fit</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Testing the business model</em><br><p>The short answer is, you don’t. Pricing is an emotion-laden topic and when confronted face to face, most people won’t give a straight answer.  You will get bad data if you attempt to ask someone face to face, “How much would you pay for this?”</p>
<p>Instead, read <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/chenelaine/primary-market-research-an-overview-on-qualitative-and-quantitative-research-techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elaine Chen’s “A primer on primary market research” on Slideshare</a> – look up the section on quantitative research, in particular check out the monadic, multiple monadic and Van Westerndrop techniques. Those are some common ways you can do pricing research.</p>
<p>Now, pricing research gets you data but it will not get the behavioral validation you need. The ultimate pricing research is when you offer your product or service to a potential economic buyer and attempt to close a deal. Offering a pilot in a B2B setting or a pre-order in a B2C or B2B setting and having actual customers send you money or issue a purchase order is the ultimate experiment in pricing research.</p></body>
