<h1>What grants and contracts might I apply for to help fund my startup?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Sector Deep Dives</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Tough Tech / Deep Tech</em><br><p>A deep tech startup rarely follows the fund raising model of typical tech-based startups, where they go from angel round to a seed round, then go through a few priced VC rounds all the way to an exit event. Typically they need more incubation time than traditional equity-based funding sources are willing to provide.</p>
<p>These startups can benefit from investigating non-equity-based funding sources like federal contracts and grants, grants from non-profits, competition prize money and the like. Check out our knowledgebase section on equity free fund raising via grants, prizes and accelerators <a href="https://orbit-kb.mit.edu/hc/en-us/categories/115000107631-Raising-money-Grants-prizes-and-accelerators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
