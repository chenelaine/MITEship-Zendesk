<h1>Culture--Bro culture is changing </h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Team Building: Leadership, Management and Culture</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Development of Culture</em><br><p>The tech startup scene has a bro culture problem. Bro culture celebrates young men at the expense of everyone else. Everybody agrees that this is a bad idea, and yet the problem exists.

<p>Read the entire article to enjoy quotable quotes like the following, and more.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1"><em>"The bro C.E.O. does what you’d expect an immature young man to do when you give him lots of money and surround him with fawning admirers — he creates a culture built on reckless spending and excessive partying, where bad behavior is not just tolerated but even encouraged."</em></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1"><em>"Bro cos. become corporate frat houses, where employees are chosen like pledges, based on “culture fit.” </em></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1"><em>"Bro C.E.O.s are better at raising money than making money."</em></p>
