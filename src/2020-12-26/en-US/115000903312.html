<h1>Why is it a bad idea to sign an NDA?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Legal </em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> NDAs</em><br><p>Dharmesh Shah, Co-Founder and CTO of Hubspot and MIT alum, has a <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/189/Startup-Reality-Distortion-3-The-Fallacy-Of-the-Non-Disclosure-Agreement-NDA.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">really excellent blog post on the whole topic of NDAs which is worth reading in its entirety</a>. In this post he recommends that startups steer away from signing NDAs. Here is a summary of his advice:</p>
<p><em>"1. It's often in your interests to share the “what” (but not details of the how) as early in the process as possible.  In this case, an NDA is not relevant.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Don’t rely on an NDA to protect the truly “secret” stuff.  It’s likely not going to give you the protection you think it is.</em></p>
<p><em>3. Your odds of actually getting someone to sign the NDA are low anyway, so it’s likely not worth the effort."</em></p></body>
