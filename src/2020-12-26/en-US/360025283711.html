<h1>What is the dollar amount of typical SBIR / STTR grants?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - Grants, prizes and accelerators</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Introduction to SBIR / STTR</em><br><p>According to the <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/about/about-sbir" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBA.GOV website</a>, as of 2020:</p>
<p><em>The SBIR Program is structured in three phases:</em></p>
<p><em>Phase I. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&amp;D efforts and to determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization prior to providing further Federal support in Phase II. SBIR Phase I awards normally do not exceed $150,000 total costs for 6 months.</em></p>
<p><em>Phase II. The objective of Phase II is to continue the R/R&amp;D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding is based on the results achieved in Phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the project proposed in Phase II. Only Phase I awardees are eligible for a Phase II award. SBIR Phase II awards normally do not exceed $1,000,000 total costs for 2 years.</em></p>
<p><em>Phase III. The objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase I/II R/R&amp;D activities. The SBIR program does not fund Phase III. Some Federal agencies, Phase III may involve follow-on non-SBIR funded R&amp;D or production contracts for products, processes or services intended for use by the U.S. Government.</em></p></body>
