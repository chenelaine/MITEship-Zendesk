<h1>What will teams be doing during the summer?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT deltav</em><br><p>All teams make significant progress toward identifying their beachhead market, building the right product, and securing initial customers or partners so that they are ready to hit escape velocity by Demo Day. Teams do this by focusing on three key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team building / organization development and dynamics</li>
<li>Truly understanding their target market, customer and users, and the associated TAM. Have the data to answer the question: “Is there something here?”</li>
<li>Learn the mechanics of venture creation (company formation, legal, financial, raising money, and so forth)</li>
</ul></body>
