<h1>What are some real life SaaS pricing models?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Business Model and Pricing</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> SaaS business models</em><br><p>Following are a few examples of real life SaaS business models. Current as of 2020-02</p>
<p><strong>OnShape: Annual subscription </strong></p>
<p>As of February 2020: OnShape.com, a cloud mechanical CAD provider and competitor to Solidworks, starts at $1500 per user per year. There was a modest price increase from 2017 to 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Solidworks: Choice of one time fee versus annual subscription</strong></p>
<p>Onshape competes head to head with Solidworks, which is a desktop app for mechical CAD. As of February 2020, CATI, a Solidworks reseller, provides a quote for Solidworks Standard at either $3995 one-time cost per named license, or $5290 for the same product with one year subscription. </p>
<p>That's one way to help customers who are used to one kind of pricing transition to another kind of pricing. "your software would be obsolete by the time you end up paying more via subscription anyways - and you get instant upgrades and you don't have to worry about maintenance in the cloud! What a GREAT deal!"</p>
<p><strong>Atlassian Jira cloud: Metered by user count</strong></p>
<p>As of February 2020: Atlassian Jira Cloud pricing is metered by user count with floor. </p>

<li>&lt;10 users: Free. Atlassian used to charge $10 per month flat rate as a nomimal fee and they took that off in 2020. </li>

<li>100-5000: $14 per user per month</li>
