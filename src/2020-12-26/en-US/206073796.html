<h1>What is product definition?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Product Management</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Defining a product</em><br><p>Product definition is the process by which a team describes what it is that they are building for their target customer(s).</p>
<p>There are many levels to product definition - a one-page summary or landing page is appropriate at the very beginning of the product development journey; as the team builds knowledge about the market, the customers and their needs and wants, more detail will come in making the product definition actionable by technical developers.</p>
