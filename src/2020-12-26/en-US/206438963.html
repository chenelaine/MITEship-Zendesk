<h1>What are the work products of the software UX design process?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Product Design</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Design for software products</em><br><p>UX design for software products typically include generating the following work products:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Information architecture (IA)</strong> - The information architect decides how all the information that the end user needs to see will be presented to them.  Taking a website for an example, the IA decides how information that needs to be presented to the end user should be structurally organized (in tabs, drop down menus and so forth) in a way that matches the mental model of the end user. This is often captured in the form of flow charts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Interactive design</strong> - The interactive Designer takes each page that will be presented to the user, and determines how the user will interact with elements on that page - be it calls to actions (buttons), hover behaviors, or multimedia presentations via videos or slideshows. This is often captured in the form of wireframes which depict the layout for each page.</li>
<li>
<strong>Graphical compositions</strong> - The Graphical Designer or Visual Designer takes the layout page by page, and comes up with a visual design that determines the final cosmetic presentation to the end user.  This person makes decisions on what most engineers associate with the design discipline: They make decisions at the pixel level. </li>
<li>
<strong>Assets</strong> - In the context of a graphical composition there are frequently assets that need to be incorporated in a software product - examples are favicons, icons, infographics, banner art, or slideshow pictures.  These are provided by the graphical or visual designer to the technical team for incorporation into the software product.</li>
</ul>
