<h1>What are the legal requirements to get a patent?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Legal </em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Intellectual Property Protection</em><br><p>There are a lot of requirements, but the two biggest ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Novelty</u>: Nobody else in the history of humankind has invented your idea and publicly disclosed it. In other words, you’ve created “the world’s first ___________” (fill in the blank).</li>
<li>
<u>Non-obvious</u>: If it is novel, then the examiner makes a somewhat subjective judgement as to whether your novel invention is a non-obvious variation over other items similar to your invention. Admittedly, this is a simplified definition of obviousness, but to keep things simple, let’s stick with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you are an experienced patent attorney, when trying to determine if patent protection is an option, focus more on <u>novelty</u> as that is easier to understand. Non-obviousness is complicated and not terribly concrete. For example, one examiner may think an invention is obvious while another may not agree.</p>
