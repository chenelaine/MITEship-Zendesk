<h1>Why is corporate entrepreneurship important?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Corporate Entrepreneurship Overview</em><br><p>At the World Economic Forum in January 2018, Justin Trudeau, Canada’s Prime Minister, famously said: “ The pace of change has never been this fast, yet it will never be this slow again.”</p>

Startups, on the other hand, are by nature iterative and experimental. Corporations need to find a way to run on two operating systems. A predictable and repeatable one for their core business, and an agile and iterative one for exploring new ventures that could become future growth businesses.</p>
