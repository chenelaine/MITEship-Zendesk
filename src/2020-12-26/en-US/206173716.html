<h1>Why should I apply to fuse?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT Fuse - 3-week mini accelerator during IAP (January)</em><br><p><a href="http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/mit-fuse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT fuse</a> gives student teams the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in the startup experience for 3 weeks.  While we do cover key concepts and skills in workshops and talks to help make you successful as an entrepreneur, the core of the fuse experience is the startup project itself.  You will be working on your project every day with your team members, and will have access to 1x1 coaching by seasoned entrepreneurs and get personalized feedback that you can apply to your own startup.  You will also build deep and lasting relationships with other teams in your tightly-knit cohort. These peer teams will become a great resource for you - they will support you, give you feedback, and help you move forward in your startup journey, just as you will do the same for them.</p></body>
