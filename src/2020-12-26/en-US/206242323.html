<h1>What kinds of teams are you looking for?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT deltav</em><br><p>You are at an early stage. You might have entered the MIT $100K, worked on your project in a course, or simply are working on the side with fellow students. You don’t have funding (not much, anyway), but you have made enough progress that this summer will be an excellent learning and growth opportunity. Quite possibly, you have even achieved some traction so that you will start the summer with momentum.</p>
<p>You are fully committed to your startup and intend to work on it full-time after the summer. You are HUNGRY and ready to put in everything you have to make it work! </p></body>
