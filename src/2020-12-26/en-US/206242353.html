<h1>What is required of my team once I am in the accelerator?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT deltav</em><br><p>We are looking for teams that are able to work the whole summer in Cambridge, MA or New York City and who are prepared to contribute to the community of teams in the accelerator by working primarily out of the Martin Trust Center or NYC Startup Studio co-working spaces. This also includes engaging in accelerator programs and extracurricular activities, as well as actively sharing and learning with other founders in the program. Teams <strong>cannot</strong> simultaneously take part in MIT delta v and any other accelerator or incubator program.</p>
<p>We expect that every participant comes to each day of the program with an open mind and great attitude, ready to learn, improve, and accelerate.</p></body>
