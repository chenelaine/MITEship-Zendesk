<p><strong>Sales – art or practice?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales skills can be learned!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales skills are some kind of an art but there is practice, discipline and strategic thinking behind it. Everything you design needs to be thought through. For example: </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you use channel sales vs direct?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you consolidate or keep your sales forces separate when acquiring another company/ being acquired?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many of sales reps should you hire?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the compensation structure?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you provide feedback, manage productivity?</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategic sales decisions will affect your product, your relationships with the customers, with your investors and many more…</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sales fundamentals</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       Attitude, enthusiasm &amp; goals</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales are all based on personal relationships - are you accessible? Are you listening? Do you ask questions to learn about your customers? Do they feel like you care?</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       Product knowledge - you really need to know your product in order to sell it well.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       Selling tactics &amp; strategies - can be learned and practiced.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Always ask yourself: what is the benefit for my customer?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decisions are made by humans, so you should learn - what motivates your target customers? Who helps/ influences their decision? What makes them feel good?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be an active listener and ask questions! the more you ask, the more your customer feels they’re in control and the more information you get.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In complex sales, or B2B, there is a lot of permeation work required. Take the time to learn about the organization structure, the decision making units</span></li>
