<h1>How do I achieve work-life balance in a startup?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Work-Life Balance</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Readings on work life balance</em><br><p>There is a great deal of conflicting materials out there about work life balance in the context of a startup. The reality is, once again, that there is no single right answer.  What works for one person and one startup may not work for another person in a different startup.</p>
<p>What you can do: Read up on what people are saying, then forget it all, and think about what makes sense for you in your startup today.  This is also something you want to reassess periodically over time - things change, and you need to adapt to new conditions continually to make sure things continue to work for you.</p>
