<h1>How do I handle international filings?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Legal </em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Intellectual Property Protection</em><br><p>Ultimately, to protect your invention in other countries, you must file for patent in other countries.  Unfortunately, this process can be enormously expensive-multiple times more expensive than the cost of protecting in the US. Thankfully, there are procedures you can use to delay that expense for 30 months or more after you first file for patent. Your US patent attorney leads that effort with patent attorneys in all of the different countries—there (thankfully!) is no need for you to look for even more patent attorneys.</p>
