<h1>Do all of my team members have to be current MIT students?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT deltav</em><br><p>We are primarily focused on accelerating the skills of MIT students. While it is acceptable to have team members who are not current MIT students, the MIT students must be at a co-founder level and have a direct say in how the venture runs. Please note that for the purposes of this program, we consider MIT students who graduate during the calendar year of the program (e.g. February or June 2020 for the summer 2020 programs) to be equivalent to current MIT students. We also consider current MIT postdocs to be current MIT students.</p></body>
