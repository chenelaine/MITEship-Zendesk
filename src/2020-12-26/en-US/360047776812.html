<h1>MIT owns some patents that I’d like to use. How can I do that?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Legal </em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Intellectual Property Protection</em><br><p>A patent is property that can be sold (“assigned”) or rented (“licensed”). Thus, if MIT owns a valuable patent, you can approach their Technology Licensing Office (TLO) to see if they will grant you rights under the patent through a sale or license.</p>
