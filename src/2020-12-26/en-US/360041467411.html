<h1>How do I rethink my content for a virtual pitch?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Anti-Fragility in the face of crisis</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Pitching, virtually</em><br><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication has always been a crucial skill for entrepreneurs. It’s even more true in our current quarantine environment to keep employees, customers, investors, and others informed in a world that is rapidly changing, by the hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, many of us will be pitching virtually for the first time - to sell to a customer, to get capital from an investor, to provide an update to your board, the list goes on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following are pro-tips on how to rethink your content from a Zoom training session, led by Michael Chad Hoeppner of GK Communications and hosted by NYU Tandon School’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Future Lab, on how to communicate effectively while pitching remotely. </span></p>

<strong>Let it go: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You worked hard on your pitch, and it’s hard to let go of a deck/pitch/story you invested time and energy into. But, entrepreneurship is all about iteration, and that’s what you need to do with your pitch. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<strong>Adjust to the new reality: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be honest about the new reality and adjust accordingly. Focus on the opportunities for your business throughout and/or on the other side of this event that’s affecting the entire world. Don’t dwell on what used to be - only what can be in the future.</span>
