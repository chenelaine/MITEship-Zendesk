<h1>How do I do primary market research?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Primary Market Research</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Getting started</em><br><p>There are many good resources but I would suggest starting with <a href="http://www.talkingtohumans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Talking to Humans” by Giff Constable</a>. This book does an excellent job of making the subject matter approachable to people who have never done primary market research before.</p>
<p>Once you get past the discovery research to build knowledge about your target customers' needs, wants and expectations, you can progress to product testing / hypothesis testing. At this point, read <a href="https://testingwithhumans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giff's second book, "Testing with humans"</a>, which gives you a great framework for this next phase of testing.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/UX-Lean-Startups-Experience-Research/dp/1449334911/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443575926&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ux+for+lean+startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“UX for Lean Startups” by Laura Klein</a> – despite the name, this book provides a really great overview of a variety of research techniques that we in the industry have been using for 25 years – adapted for the startup scenario.</p>
