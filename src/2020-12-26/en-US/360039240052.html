<h1>What does it mean to optimize your campaigns?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Marketing and Sales</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Online Advertising</em><br><p>To optimize your campaign means to make changes that will result in better results based upon tests and historical data. Costs don’t matter if people don’t convert; Lower cost per click/conversion doesn’t mean a campaign is optimized. For example, just because the cost per conversion decreased does not mean that it’s the <em>right</em> conversion. A lower cost conversion might be an Invidia who responded positively to the initial messaging but does not continue a free trial or cancels their subscription after one month for example.</p></body>
