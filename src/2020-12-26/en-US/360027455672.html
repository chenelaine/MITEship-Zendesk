<h1>Tool Kit </h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Legal </em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Getting started</em><br><p>Of course, all of the documents have obligatory disclaimers that they are just templates and should be tailored to each company’s needs, or at least never adopted without each signatory fully reading and understanding the terms.
