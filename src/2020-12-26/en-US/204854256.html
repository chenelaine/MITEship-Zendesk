<h1>Where can I get coaching and mentorship help in and around MIT?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Coaching and Mentorship</em><br><p>If your startup has at least one founder who is a currently enrolled MIT student, you can come to the <a href="http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship</a> for coaching support. The Trust Center provides coaching to students as the need arises, stocks ramen noodles and serves free coffee, and is also home to a lot of resources available to enrolled students at MIT. Students may email eir@mit.edu to request a meeting and their request is typically met within a couple of days.  Any student with startup related questions may request a meeting - they do not need to be with a previously formed startup team.</p>
<p>If you have no current students but at least one founder is affiliated with MIT, and you are in a previously formed team that is committed to building a new venture together, you can try the <a href="http://vms.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT Venture Mentorship Service (VMS)</a> which serves all of the MIT community. This is a structured mentorship program in which VMS will assign a team of highly accomplished mentors, who will meet with the startup team once every few weeks over a period of several months (or longer if it makes sense) to help them build and grow their business over time.  </p>
<p>Note: Current students may also work with VMS at the same time they work with the Trust Center - the coaching and mentoring that they get from either experience is very complementary.</p>
<p>There are also many programs at MIT that provides mentorship as a part of their offerings. MIT Sandbox, DesignX, Deshpande Center all support programs that connect students to mentors as a part of their benefits.</p>
<p>If your startup does not have any affiliation with MIT, you can leverage the <a href="http://www.mitforumcambridge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT Enterprise Forum of Cambridge</a>, which serves the entire startup community in the area. The MIT Enterprise Forum runs a Mentor Smart program twice a year – applications are due by October 2, 2015 for the Fall 2015 cohort.</p></body>
