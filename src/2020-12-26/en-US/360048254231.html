<h1>A license sounds like a big commitment. I’m not ready for that yet. Can I wait a while to take a license?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Legal </em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Intellectual Property Protection</em><br><p>A party interested in licensing a patent may ask the patent owner to hold the patent open for potential license until an agreed upon date. Of course, the interested party typically pays the patent owner for this right. Universities commonly do this by granting an “option” to a party to exclusively license the patent by some agreed upon date.</p>
