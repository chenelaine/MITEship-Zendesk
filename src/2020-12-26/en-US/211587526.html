<h1>What should entrepreneurs think about in planning out a business strategy?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Strategy</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Planning</em><br><p><strong>Take-aways from a talk in the Trust Center on 6/24/16</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Your strategy dictates the sustainability of your company</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While two companies can start at the same time, have a similar idea and a similar technology, the strategy they set will take them in different paths and lead to different results.</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Coinbase vs. Ripple: both want to engage with blockchain technology but Coinbase is trying to lead a platform for bitcoin while the other is trying to create a competing new platform as the “Anti-Bitcoin”</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge is to implement your idea in a way that creates value and helps you capture value</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> The “Action vs. Planning” entrepreneurial conflict </strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Action<span style="font-weight: 400;"> - use when there is an obvious path and all you need to do is implement.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Planning <span style="font-weight: 400;">- use when you can get significant insights based on models/frameworks without the actual execution.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the real startup world - it’s usually a mix! </span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to really learn you need to also go out there and interact with your customers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you view as experience, your potential customers view as their first impression of your start up. They evaluate you and decide on future interaction based on this.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Managing the uncertainty of different paths</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Axiom 1: </strong>There is more than one potential path to create and capture value from an idea (True for most ventures, not all)</li>
<ul>
<li>Example: Starbucks: Selling high end coffee for customers can either be selling the beans or be opening cafe’s.</li>
</ul>
<li>
<strong>Axiom 2:</strong> Without moving down a specific path, uncertainty prevents ranking of alternatives</li>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Webvan vs. Peapod:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Same concept: internet meets groceries.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Different strategy: Collaboration with grocery stores vs. disruption of the existing market.</span></strong></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it’s hard to know in advance which strategy will take the market and the only way to learn is to try.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<strong>Axiom 3: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing to move along one path changes the way you can move towards future paths</span>
</li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paradox: choosing the right strategy/path requires knowledge and insights that can only be gained through real life experiences.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
