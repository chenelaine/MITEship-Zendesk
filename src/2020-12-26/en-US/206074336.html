<h1>How can I put up a website without doing any coding?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Marketing and Sales</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Marketing Presence</em><br><p>Every new business needs a website and a custom URL, but you don't need to be a web developer to be able to get one up and running.  These days there are a large number of hosted services that allow people who are not programmers or web developers to create stunningly beautiful web sites by using a drag-and-drop interface to customize a website based on a pre-existing template.  Some example services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Square space - best for simple sites with very few pages and/or simple commerce sites</li>
<li>Weebly or Wix - more difficult to build a beautiful site, but provides a little more flexibility in site architecture</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use all-in-one marketing platforms to consolidate your website, content marketing and social presence.</p>
<ul>
<li>ThriveHive is an MIT startup (since acquired - and the parent company took ThriveHive's name) that provides an all in one marketing solution to small and medium businesses who frequently lack the skillset or bandwidth to build their own website.</li>
<li>Hubspot is another MIT startup (now publicly traded) that provides an all in one marketing solution to mid sized businesses, complete with all kinds of analytics that help customers do growth hacking effectively. </li>
</ul>
