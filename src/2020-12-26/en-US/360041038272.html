<h1>How do I deliver a powerful physical stage presence?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Anti-Fragility in the face of crisis</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Pitching, virtually</em><br><p>Following are best practices on physical presence and awareness of your surroundings while doing a virtual pitch, covered in<strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a Zoom training session, led by Michael Chad Hoeppner of GK Communications and hosted by NYU Tandon School’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Future Lab, on how to communicate effectively while pitching remotely.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stand instead of sit. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing ensures you maintain great posture. It also prevents your diaphragm from crunching and therefore requires less energy to speak.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Look directly at the camera</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Put something next to your computer’s camera to remind you of this so that you do not appear to be reading a script or your slides. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Over communicate what you’re doing during the call</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>.</strong> You’re likely going to take notes about the feedback you’re getting, but no one on a video call can see that pad of paper next to you. So instead, they’ll assume you’re texting, or getting bored, or something else! Over communicate so others can’t make their own assumptions about what you’re doing.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lighting is important.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural light coming at you from the front is most ideal.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>What’s in your shot?</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware of what’s in your camera’s line of site. Take a screenshot of yourself when you are doing a dry run, and review what needs to be moved.</span>
</li>
