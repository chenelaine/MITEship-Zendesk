<h1>What are the requirements for the Principal Investigator (PI) in the proposal?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - Grants, prizes and accelerators</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Eligibility for SBIR / STTR grants</em><br><p>The Principal Investigator (PI) in an SBIR proposal must be primarily employed by the company submitting the proposal. That means they must spend at least 50% of their time working on the startup. This means the PI cannot be a full time faculty member at an academic institution, or a full time employee of another company.</p>
<p>This is what the <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/applicants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SBIR.GOV</a> site says about the Principal Investigator and the proposing firm:</p>
<p><em>"For SBIR, the primary employment of the principal investigator must be with the small business, and the proposing firm must perform at least 2/3rds of the R&amp;D work in Phase I and at least 1/2 in Phase II".</em></p>
