<h1>Why don't you offer credit for this activity? </h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT Fuse - 3-week mini accelerator during IAP (January)</em><br><p>Our goal is to provide the best simulation of an immersive startup experience for students who are considering a career starting companies or working in a startup. Offering credit means we will have to grade student teams on their performance, which is not what this experience is all about.Â </p></body>
