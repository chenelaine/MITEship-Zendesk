<h1>What are the pitfalls of doing final assembly myself?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Scaling - Manufacturing</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Final assembly</em><br><p>The DIY approach may result in the least out of pocket expense, but is rarely the best choice for anything beyond a prototype build (50 units or less). Here are the issues with the DIY approach. </p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity cost (what is not being done while you spend 4 weeks personally building, boxing, and shipping products?)</li>
<li>Scalability.  What happens when you go from 2000 to 20,000? Do you have space in your basement to store all that product?</li>
<li>Consistency and quality of build. Let’s face it. A great engineer is probably not a great technician.  You will be tempted to improve things every 5 or 10 units.  The result is an artisanal lot where each one is a unique work of art. That’s great if you are selling works of art, and not great when you are making a consumer electronics product (or an industrial automation product).</li>
