<h1>How do I hold a virtual networking session?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Anti-Fragility in the face of crisis</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Transforming in-person interactions to an online format</em><br><p>Freeform networking with a glass of wine in one hand and tasty snacks in the other is not the easiest thing to replicate via video conferencing.</p>
<p>The reason why in-person networking is so difficult to bring on line is serendipity. People meet after overhearing a snippet of interesting conversation, or seeing an interesting app or solution that another person is showing someone else. A lot of times, people introduce their friends to others in their circle, thus melding and expanding people’s networks. This is very difficult to replicate on line.</p>
<p>Having said that, we can reap <em>some</em> of the benefits of in-person networking in a virtual format by hosting an open meeting on line with large audiences. There are some precedences. For example, Rachel Hentsch, MIT Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp alumna, has hosted <a href="https://www.d-eship.com/articles/lessons-learned-25-hours-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#24hours#24steps</a>, a 24 hour virtual event for participants all over the world, exclusively on line. Venture Cafe Cambridge is hosting <a href="https://venturecafecambridge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual cafes</a>. Startup Boston has started organizing <a href="https://meetaway.com/event/1584289003202x795038008604360700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual founder’s happy hours</a>.</p>
<p>When there is a will, there is a way. Following are some truly creative ideas for virtual networking events that I have overheard in the past few days. I cannot wait to try them out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize an event with a large number of participants. Create a lot of breakout rooms in advance. Start out in the “big room”, explain the rules – then start randomly assigning 3-5 people into a breakout room. Leave them there for 5-10 minutes – then switch them up randomly in a new room with different people. Rinse and repeat.</li>
<li>Set up open virtual rooms with themes, and allow anybody with the link to “walk in” and have a conversation with others in the “room”</li>
<li>Set up a virtual “water cooler” or “coffee machine” to be “open for business” for the same hours the water cooler would be open for business – and let people wander in and out and have conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do ad-hoc networking and relationship building on line. We just need to accept that it will be a different experience, with different food and drink. So long as our expectations are aligned with what the virtual experience offers, we can make this work.</p>
