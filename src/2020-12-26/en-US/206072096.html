<h1>How do I give a GREAT presentation?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Pitching, Presentations and Public Speaking</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Preparing for a talk</em><br><p>David Rose has a <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/david_s_rose" target="_blank">fabulous must-see TED Talk</a> that explains the anatomy of a 10 minute VC pitch and how to win your next meeting with the VC.</p>
<p>Nancy Duarte has an interesting TED talk that theorizes that great talks start with the "what is" state, and paints a picture of the "what will be" state, and holds the audience's interest by going back and forth between those two states. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_duarte_the_secret_structure_of_great_talks?language=en" target="_blank">"The secret structure of great talks".</a></p>
<p>Simon Sinek has a great TED talk that is more focused on how leaders communicate, but the core tenets of "Start with Why" very much still holds. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en" target="_blank">"How great leaders inspire action".</a></p>
