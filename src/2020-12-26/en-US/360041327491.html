<h1>How do I build relationships with my virtual employees?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Anti-Fragility in the face of crisis</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Maintaining cohesiveness and alignment in a virtual team</em><br><p>The old-school method of management-by-walking-about (MBWA) is hugely effective. Building relationships longitudinally by having a lot of mini touch times with each person. </p>
<p>In this time of virtual team management, the leader needs to do even more of MBWA (albeit virtually). Have a lot of sidebars with each person on the instant messaging platform. There is value in group conversations in a channel or chat room, but 1×1 conversations really help build trust and confidence. A virtual workforce actually affords more opportunity for this (because physical proximity is no longer a limiting factor).</p>
