<h1>What tools can help me convert hallway conversations to an online format?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Anti-Fragility in the face of crisis</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> How to use technology to help us go virtual</em><br><p>There are always times for a quick conversations that used to happen as a hallway conversation, or a "drive by". “Hey X, do you have 5 minutes?” Remote tools actually makes this interaction work better.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>An instant messaging (IM) platform is a life-safer</strong>. An instant messaging platform is an excellent way to virtualize this interaction. I personally prefer <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> over everything else. (Apologies to <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skype</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/hipchat/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hipchat</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/?nc=sn&amp;loc=1&amp;chime-blog-posts.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&amp;chime-blog-posts.sort-order=desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Chime</a>.) This is better than real life “drive-by”‘s. You are not interrupting the other person. Instead, you are affording the other person the courtesy of letting them respond when they can. Innovation!</li>
<li>
<strong>Good old fashioned texting.</strong> This is a good Plan B when you have unreliable internet connectivity. Everyone knows how to use this. An alternative is WhatsApp chat. Whatever you do – pick one fallback mechanism and stick with it. Two is confusing enough, three is way too much confusion.</li>
