<h1>How is the Trust Center program different from other startup accelerators?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT deltav</em><br><ul>
<li>MIT delta v is an educational accelerator designed to support MIT student entrepreneurs and help them accelerate their progress towards validating their target market and starting to build a viable, sustainable venture.</li>
<li>We offer a customized, coaching-based approach, meeting teams where they are and helping them succeed.</li>
<li>These accelerators do not take equity from founding teams.</li>
<li>MIT delta v teams must have at least one current MIT student co-founder; other teams are not eligible.</li>
<li>The Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship offers access to a great deal of resources to student teams on and off campus.</li>
