<h1>Are there any resources for me to learn about leadership in a startup setting?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Team Building: Leadership, Management and Culture</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Entrepreneurial leadership</em><br><p>There are similarities and differences between leadership in a corporate setting and leadership in a startup setting.  In a startup, things move much more quickly, teams are much smaller and more cross functional, and the leadership challenges faced by founders are often unique.  There were a series of videos made back in 2010 in support of a course at MIT that you may find helpful - check them out.</p>
