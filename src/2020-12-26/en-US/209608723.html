<p>Second, Ali Afri, a product manager formerly associated with General Catalyst, has compiled this list of resources for students looking for money in 2016.

Note that Trust Center does not maintain this list, nor do we endorse any of the funding sources - this link is provided for the convenience of student entrepreneurs only.</p>
