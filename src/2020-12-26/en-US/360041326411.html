<h1>How do I give a talk online and manage the tech and audience at the same time?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Anti-Fragility in the face of crisis</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Transforming in-person interactions to an online format</em><br><p>Focusing on delivering a high energy, engaging talk to a camera instead of to human beings is difficult. As speakers, we really don’t want to also have to worry about audience management at the same time.</p>
<p>And so: If you are doing a talk via a webinar format, I highly recommend designating someone to serve as your webinar manager. This person can be the virtual moderator and technology wrangler all in one.</p>
<p>The moderator can process the audience input in real time while the speaker focuses on delivering a compelling talk. The moderator can then send guidance to the speaker via a private chat. With a little practice, this can work very well.</p>
