<h1>Why would I use digital advertising at an early stage?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Marketing and Sales</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Online Advertising</em><br><p>Digital advertising is a great way for large, established companies to grow sales. It can also be a useful tool for earlier stage companies to test assumptions and validate a solution. Put simply, digital advertising is a quick way to test whether people want what youâ€™re offering. For example, you might try testing a variety of components of your business including the problem, persona, and/or solution. With digital advertising you can not only test assumptions; you can gather data that allows you to prove validity with statistical significance.</p></body>
