<h1>Are there any visa or work permit issues for international students?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> MIT Specific questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> MIT deltav</em><br><p>If you are an international student who will be graduating from MIT by June 2020, you will need to secure F-1 post-completion Optional Practical Training authorization before being able to participate since you will no longer be an enrolled student.</p>
<p>For international students who will be continuing their education at MIT on an F-1 visa, participation in MIT delta v is considered on-campus employment since you are receiving stipends from MIT.  Therefore, no CPT or OPT authorization would be required.</p></body>
