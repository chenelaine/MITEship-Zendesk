<h1>What are the pitfalls of hiring interns to do final assembly?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Scaling - Manufacturing</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Final assembly</em><br><p>Hiring interns is slightly less stressful than doing it yourself but there are still quality issues you will need to grapple with. </p>
<ul>
<li>Your assemblers and testers do not have years of experience doing this, and are limited by your ability to train them, and their ability to absorb what needs to be done. (Do you have years of experience as a supervisor in a manufacturing cell doing final assembly, so you can train your people correctly?)</li>
<li>Your interns and friends may have limited availability, and you may need to train a large number of people to aggregate enough hours to build the entire lot – resulting in operator-related variability.</li>
</ul>
