<h1>What is the Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> General questions</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Startup / Entrepreneurship Frameworks</em><br><p>The Disciplined Entrepreneurship Framework is what Bill Aulet, Managing Director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, outlined in his book:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disciplined-Entrepreneurship-Steps-Successful-Startup/dp/1118692284/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443639741&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=disciplined+entrepreneurship" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> "Disciplined Entrepreneurship: 24 Steps to a Successful Startup"</a>.  It outlines the six steps that founders should take to build a successful new venture.  It is the framework we use in several of our Entrepreneurship and Innovation classes, including 15.390 and  15.378/3781 as well as other programs such as StartIAP and GFSA. </p>
