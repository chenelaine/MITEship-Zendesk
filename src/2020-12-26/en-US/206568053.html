<h1>How do I raise seed capital?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - equity based</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Raising an angel or seed round</em><br><p>The fund raising process for seed rounds is completely different from the process for raising a traditional institutional venture round (i.e. what is common called a Series A, B, C, D or up).  Rob Go from Nextview Ventures has <a href="http://nextviewventures.com/blog/how-to-raise-seed-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fantastic article that demystifies this process and provides a step by step guide</a>.  In this 2018 article, he outlines the six steps to raise a seed round:</p>
<p>1. Line up support for references (this will be useful during due diligence)</p>
<p>2. Get commitments from people who know you. This helps jump-start the process.</p>
<p>3. Find a lead investor. Not every seed fund leads - look at the investment history of the seed funds to identify potential funds who might lead your round.</p>
<p>4. Secure value-adding, non-lead investors. These people bring connections or knowhow.</p>
<p>5. Have good news to share along the way (e.g. results from MVP tests)</p>
<p>6. When you get a term sheet, do some work to optimize the deal.</p>
