<h1>What is a convertible note?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Raising money - equity based</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Convertible notes and safe notes</em><br><p>A convertible note is one of several ways to structure an early financing round before a properly priced equity round. Another way is the "safe note". </p>
<p>According to http://seedinvest.com, the definition of a convertible note is as follows:</p>
<p>"A <strong>convertible note</strong> is a form of short-term <strong>debt</strong> that converts into equity, typically in conjunction with a future financing round; in effect, the investor would be loaning money to a startup and instead of a return in the form of principal plus interest, the investor would receive equity in the company."</p>
