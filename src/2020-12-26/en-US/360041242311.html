<h1>Should I use all-in-one platforms or best-in-class tools for each type of interaction?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Anti-Fragility in the face of crisis</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> How to use technology to help us go virtual</em><br><p>There are a lot of technology platforms out there that enable remote work. Some focus only on one interaction model (e.g. video conference, instant messaging), others are integrated, all-in-one platforms that do everything.</p>
<p>I personally prefer to use the best-in-class platform for each mode of communication. For example, I prefer Zoom for video conferencing, and Slack for instant messaging. Others may prefer a more integrated experience where you can have meetings and instant messaging within the same platform (for example: Skype, Amazon Chime). Your mileage may vary.</p>
