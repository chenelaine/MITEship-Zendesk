<h1>What is TAM?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Business Model and Pricing</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> TAM (Total Addressable Market)</em><br><p>In the lingo of new venture development (whether in a startup or a corporate entrepreneurship endeavor), TAM refers to Total Addressable Market. Wikipedia defines TAM as follows:</p>
<p><em>"Total addressable market (TAM), or total available market, is the total market demand for a product or service,<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup>Â calculated in annual revenue or unit sales if 100% of available market is achieved." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></em></p>
<p>TAM is important because it is a measurement of market size. A venture with a low TAM will not be attractive to investors. <a href="https://orbit-kb.mit.edu/hc/en-us/articles/206445846-What-makes-a-startup-investable-or-fundable-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See this article about what makes a startup fundable</a> to see how TAM and growth rate plays into that equation.</p></body>
