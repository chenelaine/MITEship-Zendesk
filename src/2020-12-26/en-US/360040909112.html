<h1>What tools can help me convert scheduled meetings to an online format?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Anti-Fragility in the face of crisis</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> How to use technology to help us go virtual</em><br><p>Scheduled meetings are easy to take on line. The general behaviors are largely the same. Find a time that works for everyone; put it on the calendar; now book a room. The only difference is that the room is now a virtual room.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A full-featured video conferencing platform.</strong> I personally prefer <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a> over everything else out there. (Sorry <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skype</a>, <a href="https://www.webex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebEx</a>, <a href="https://www.gotomeeting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoTo Meeting</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/?nc=sn&amp;loc=1&amp;chime-blog-posts.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&amp;chime-blog-posts.sort-order=desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Chime</a>) Most platforms allow unlimited 1×1 conversations on unpaid plans. I strongly recommend going to a paid plan. This is not a time to economize.</li>
<li>
<strong>Calling into a video conference from a landline or mobile phone.</strong> This is a Plan B for that time when your house suffers a brown-out – and you lose internet. This is also one way to onboard people new to video conferencing because it works like phone conferences.</li>
<li>
<strong>WhatsApp calls</strong> <strong>(with or without video)</strong> can be an alternative to the above for 1×1 calls. WhatsApp Video Calls consume less bandwidth than most video conferencing platforms. For this reason, WhatsApp delivers a more reliable video calling experience if one or both parties has bandwidth problems.</li>
</ul>
