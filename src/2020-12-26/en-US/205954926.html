<h1>How do you scale without adding more employees?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Scaling - Process and Infrastructure</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Scaling your team </em><br><p>A challenge for a leadership team is to find a way to deal with added complexity that acknowledges and incorporates human limits. </p>
<p>The goal is to put in just enough structure and process that you feel like you’re giving up ground grudgingly. Push until things crack, but not until they break. Questions you can ask?   Do we have too many projects or experiments going versus a streamline approach to delivering the customer the product or service? Is the same team always under the gun so there is no relief? Is the culture aligned to the values?</p></body>
