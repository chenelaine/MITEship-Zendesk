<h1>How can I protect my innovations? I’ve heard of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, etc.</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Legal </em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Intellectual Property Protection</em><br><p>To protect your innovation, you can apply for a US patent. Its owner can stop anyone else (an “infringer”) from<u>making</u>, <u>using</u>, or <u>selling</u> the patented invention in the US. In fact, the owner of the patent can stop an infringer even if the infringer independently developed the technology themselves by accident.</p>
<p>There are three other ways to protect your intellectual property, although these FAQs focus on patents. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trademarks: Protects your brand</li>
<li>Copyrights: Protects your creative works</li>
<li>Trade Secrets: Protects information that is valuable to a company (e.g., processes of making things, formulas, customer lists, etc.).</li>
</ul>
