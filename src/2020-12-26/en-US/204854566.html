<h1>How do you gauge purchase intent in an interview?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Testing your MVP and Finding Product/Market Fit</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Testing the business model</em><br><p>What you should NOT do is ask them “Would you buy it?” especially not “Would you buy it for $xxx?”</p>
<p>What you can do is ask them what they have done to solve the problem you are talking about. For example, did they spend $$ in the past 12 months to buy some product or service that solves some aspect of this problem? That is a good indication that there is a real pain that they will pay money for.</p>
<p>You should NEVER do pricing research in person. Always do it via one of the standard survey vehicles, quantitatively.
