<h1>How should I report on my digital advertising campaign metrics/results?</h1><br><em><strong>CATEGORY:</strong> Marketing and Sales</em><br><em><strong>SECTION:</strong> Online Advertising</em><br><p>All of your digital advertising metrics are great for optimizing your campaigns because they show you what works and what doesnâ€™t. However, you will need to aggregate the results to present to stakeholders. Nobody wants to see a messy spreadsheet or screenshots from the ad platform. It is your job to present the data in a manner that others will easily understand so that you can justify the ad spend.</p>
<p>Make sure to report on customer acquisition cost and the value of a customer to give a good sense of your return on investment. These two metrics represent your COCA (cost of customer acquisition) and LTV (lifetime value), which are invaluable indicators of business viability. Keep in mind that the metrics that represent your digital advertising efforts are siloed and do not consider other costs associated with customer acquisition.</p></body>
